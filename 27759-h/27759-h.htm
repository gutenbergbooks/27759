<h3>HIS LIFE</h3>

<p class="smaller center">(BORN 1441: DIED 1523)</p>


<p>It is a curious fact that, considering the number of
documents which exist relating to Signorelli, and
the paintings time has spared, so little should be known
beyond the merest outline of his life. The very dates
of his birth and death are indirectly acquired; the
documents leave his youth and early manhood an
absolute blank, and there are only two of his numerous
works which can with certainty be placed before his
thirty-third year.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We are, therefore, forced to fall back
upon traditionary record, and by the aid of his biographer
Vasari, and the evidence of youthful studies which his
paintings contain, to patch together a probable account
of his life, up to the time when the documents begin.
On Vasari, in this case, we can depend with a certain
amount of confidence, since Signorelli was his
kinsman, and they had been in such personal communication
as was possible between an old man and
a child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>From Vasari, then, we learn that Luca was born in
Cortona, of Egidio Signorelli, and a sister of Lazzaro
d&egrave; Taldi.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This Lazzaro, great grandfather of the
biographer, deserves special mention, since it was through
his means, and under his guardianship, that Luca was
placed as a child to study painting with Pier dei
Franceschi, at Arezzo.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Vasari tells us that Lazzaro
was "a famous painter of his time, not only in his own
country, but throughout Tuscany, with a style of painting
hardly to be distinguished from that of his great friend,
Pietro della Francesca."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This, however, is an assertion
that has never been supported, and was probably based
on the author's pride in his own family, for in the
Cortona tax-receipts for the year 1427, he is described
merely as a harness-maker (<i>Sellajo di Cavalli</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> There
is, besides, no record of him among the painters of Arezzo,
and no fragment remains of the many works enumerated
by his great-grandson. But it is of little consequence
whether he was a painter of pictures or a decorator of
saddles; what is to our purpose is the fact, that by his
means Luca was placed under the tutelage of the painter
most capable of developing the noblest qualities of his
genius.</p>

<p>Luca was born about 1441, as we gather from Vasari,
and if 1452 is the correct date of his uncle Lazzaro's
death, his apprenticeship to Pier dei Franceschi must
have begun before his eleventh year. It is probable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
that, with his fellow-pupil Melozzo da Forl&igrave;, his senior
by three years, Signorelli assisted the master with the
frescoes in S. Francesco, although there is no trace of
any work that might be from his hand. Vasari tells us
that as a youth he laboured "to imitate the style of his
master," with such success, that (as he remarked of
Lazzaro) their work was hardly to be distinguished
apart."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The nearest approach to the style of Piero
that remains to us is "The Flagellation," of the Brera,
Milan, which, however, already shows signs of a more
deeply impressed technical influence, but it was probably
under Piero's training that Signorelli developed his
broad methods of work, and the grand manner which
makes his painting so impressive. The later influence
visible in the above-mentioned "Flagellation," as throughout
all his work, is that of Antonio Pollaiuolo. To him
and to Donatello are due the most important features in
his artistic development, and in technique he follows
much more readily than the Umbrian, the Florentine
methods, with which his painting has nearly everything
in common. Of the influence of Donatello it may justly
be said that every painter and sculptor of the fifteenth
century submitted to it, but few were so completely
touched by his spirit as Signorelli. Not only, as we
shall see later, did he transfer attitudes and features
from Donatello's statues into his earlier paintings, but
he caught, and even exaggerated, the confident and
somewhat arrogant spirit of his work, and exploited it
with the same uncompromising realism.</p>

<p>The influence of Antonio Pollaiuolo was still more
important, and is so evident in the whole mass of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
painting, that with no other warrant we may feel certain
that he spent a considerable time either as pupil or
assistant to the Florentine master. The passion of
Pollaiuolo was to discover the science of movement in
the human frame. "He understood the nude in a more
modern way than the masters before him," says Vasari,
"and he removed the skin from many corpses to see
the anatomy beneath."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He was, in fact, the great
anatomical student among the Quattrocento artists; and,
having the same tastes, it was natural that to his workshop
Signorelli should turn, in order to satisfy his own
craving for knowledge of the structure of bones and
muscles. The internal evidence of his paintings warrants
this supposition, but there is no record of any residence
in Florence, beyond the announcement of Vasari, that
he went there after his visit to Siena, not at all as a
student, but as a fully-fledged painter, making gifts of
his pictures to his friend and patron, Lorenzo dei Medici.
His work, however, proves so incontestably the training
of Pollaiuolo, and shows so close an acquaintance with
Florentine works of art, that we may safely presume the
greater part of his youth, after leaving the studio of
Pier dei Franceschi, to have been passed in Florence as
pupil or assistant of Antonio.</p>

<p>It is a wide leap from these days of study to the
beginning of his citizen's life in Cortona, when, a man
of thirty-eight, he first settled down as a burgher
discharging important duties there, but it would be idle
to attempt to fill the gap, and only one document exists
to help in any way to bridge it over. This is a commission
from the Commune of Citt&agrave; di Castello, dated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
1474,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> requiring Signorelli to paint, over some older
frescoes in their Tower, a large "Madonna and Saints,"
but, unfortunately the work itself no longer exists, for
what time and neglect had spared, the earthquake of
1789 completely destroyed. We may presume that
before 1479 he painted the important frescoes for the
Church of the Holy House at Loreto, since in that year
he was first appointed to the municipal offices in Cortona,
which necessitated an almost constant residence there
for the next three years, as the documents of election
show.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These numerous papers (for the most part discovered
through the efforts of Signor Girolamo Mancini,
and published in his "Notizie"), are preserved in the
archives of Cortona, and form the chief evidence of the
painter's whereabouts up to the end of his long life.
They record, first, his appointment in the autumn of
1479 to the Council of XVIII., and to the Conservatori
degli Ordinamente,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in the following spring to the
Priori, and in the summer to the General Council, and
they continue with few interruptions up to the very day
of his death. They decide for us the social status he
enjoyed, for both Priori and Councillors were chosen
from the richest and most influential families, although
not necessarily noble.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> His official life began in a time
of tumult and bloodshed. It was the year after the
failure of the Pazzi Conspiracy, and all around Cortona<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
were pitched the camps of the rival troops of Sixtus IV.
and the excommunicated Florentines. Cortona itself,
as a frontier town of the Medici, was in the very centre
of the fray; and besides these more important quarrels,
there were the incessant internal bickerings between the
nobles and the populace, which at that time divided
every Italian city against itself. Altogether, the
position of Magistrate in such a town, at such a time,
could have been no sinecure, and it is difficult to
understand how the hard-working painter could have
found time or inclination to accept the citizen's duties,
which were so weighty an occupation in themselves.</p>

<p>Much time has been spent in the vain search for
documents relating to Signorelli's supposed visit, in
1484, to Rome, where, it is said, he was summoned to
paint, with Perugino, Pintorricchio, Botticelli, and Cosimo
Rosselli, the walls of the Sistine Chapel. Later
criticism has perhaps accounted for the absence of such
a record. Of the two frescoes there, formerly attributed
to him, it is now no longer doubted that one&mdash;"The
Journey of Moses and Zipporah"&mdash;is by Pintorricchio,
and the opinion is gradually gaining ground that the
other&mdash;"The Death of Moses"&mdash;although much nearer
to Signorelli's style, is not sufficiently so as to permit us
to accept it as his work.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The notices of the next few years contain little of
interest beyond the facts, that in 1484 Signorelli painted
the altar-piece in the Perugia Cathedral, the first dated
picture remaining, and that in 1488 he received the
much-coveted honour of citizenship from Citt&agrave; di
Castello, for the "great ability" with which he painted
a standard for the brotherhood of the Blessed Virgin,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
a work which no longer exists. Soon after follows a
document dated 1491, which bears witness that Luca
had been invited by the authorities of Santa Maria dei
Fiori in Florence to assist in judging the models and
designs for the projected fa&ccedil;ade of that church.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This
is important as a proof of the high esteem in which he
was held in Florence, implying also that he must have
understood something of architecture. He declined the
invitation, perhaps for the same reason for which he had
excused himself the month before from serving as Priore
in his native town, "being absent at a distance of over
forty miles,"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> probably at Volterra. He painted there
in this year three pictures, all of which are still in the
city; the "Annunciation" and the "Madonna and
Saints," dated 1491, and the fresco of "S. Jerome" on
the walls of the Municipio.</p>

<p>The next notice of importance is of the year 1497,
when he received the commission from the monks of
S. Benedict to fresco the walls of their cloister at Monte
Oliveto.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Here he painted eight episodes from the life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of the patron saint, leaving the rest of the work to be
completed by Sodoma. Notwithstanding this task he
found time, for four months of this very year, to serve
among the Priori in Cortona, and accepted, besides, a
fresh appointment as one of the Revisori degli Argenti.</p>

<p>In the following year he was in Siena, where he
painted the altar-piece for the Bicchi family, the wings
of which are now in Berlin.</p>

<p class="caption center">PORTRAIT OF SIGNORELLI</p>
</div>

<p>We have now reached the most important time
in Signorelli's life, the year in which he received the
commission for the decoration of the Cappella Nuova
in the Cathedral of Orvieto. Fifty years before, the
roof had been begun by Fra Angelico, and ever since
he went away, leaving it unfinished, the authorities had
been undecided to whom to give the important work.
Benozzo Gozzoli had begged for it; Perugino, it is said,
had refused it; and now, in 1499, perhaps influenced to
the choice by the success of the Monte Oliveto frescoes,
they entrusted the work to Signorelli. Wishing first,
however, to test his powers, they limited the commission
to the completion of the vaulting, and it was not till the
following year that they handed over to him the rest
of the chapel, to be painted with the story of the Last
Judgment. With this dramatic subject, and in these
great spaces of the walls he had for the first time a free
field for the wide sweep of his brush, and the force of
his vivid imagination. The conceptions of Dante
inspired, but did not trammel him, and he had sufficient
strength to make the great drama his own, and to
compel it to serve his ends in the display of the human
frame in its most vigorous aspects. The portrait he
has painted of himself in the first of the frescoes, as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
as that in the Opera del Duomo, show us a man in the
very prime of life, full of energy and determination.</p>

<p>Four years at least, Signorelli laboured at these
frescoes, although not consecutively, as we shall
presently see. He had with him as assistant his son
Polidoro,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and perhaps Girolamo Genga, and other
pupils. He was apparently on friendly terms with the
authorities, of one of whom, the treasurer Niccol&ograve;
Francesco, he painted a portrait, side by side with his
own above mentioned. It is on a brick or tile, on the
back of which is a flattering inscription, evidently
composed by Niccol&ograve; himself, in which he speaks of
Signorelli as "worthy of comparison with Apelles."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding this friendship with the treasurer,
he could not get the money due to him, and it required
the intervention of no less a person than Guidobaldo
of Urbino, in 1506, to obtain it for him. A letter from
the Prince is preserved in the Orvieto archives,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in which
he writes: "Loving Maestro Luca di Cortona as I do,
in no common measure, for his ability and rare talents,
I can refuse him no possible favour in all that he
may require of me," and goes on to beg the authorities
for their love to him, to pay their debt to the
painter, "which assuredly will be to me the greatest
favour."</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Cortona</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE DEPOSITION</p>
</div>

<p>Even in fulfilling so arduous an undertaking as these
great frescoes Luca did not abandon his magistrate's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
work in his own city, and during the time, was serving
both on the General Council and as one of the Priori.
In 1502, moreover, he found time to paint for his
Cathedral at Cortona the beautiful "Deposition," in
which is a repetition of the Piet&agrave; of the Capella Nuova.
The realism and pathos of this dead Christ are so convincing
as to have given rise to the legend that it was
painted from the body of his son, who died, or was
killed, in this year. Vasari thus relates the incident:
Luca had a son, "beautiful in face and person, whom
he loved most dearly," killed in Cortona, whereupon,
"overwhelmed with grief as he was, he had the body
stripped, and with the greatest fortitude of soul, without
tears or lamentation, he made a drawing of it, in
order to have always before his eyes ... what Nature
had given him, and cruel Fate had snatched away."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
This son, Antonio, probably a painter also, must have
been a man of mature years at the time of his death,
for he was already married to a second wife. The
story has taken hold of the fancy of Signorelli's
biographers, in the dearth of personal matter, and is
the best known incident in his life, but it is more than
probable that Antonio was carried off by the plague
which, following close on the heels of the war of 1502,
attacked Cortona, in which case it becomes a mere
legend. We learn from a document, dated June 23rd,
that the painter's house was not spared, for he excused
himself from serving as Priore in that month, because
the <i>peste bubbonica</i> had broken out in his family.</p>

<p>Four years later, Polidoro, his eldest son, and his
assistant at Orvieto, died also. This happened while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Signorelli was on a visit to Siena, for it was there he
bought the mourning cloth. The object of this visit
was to design one of the subjects for the famous
pavement of the Cathedral, but whether he ever did
it we do not know; certainly it was never executed
in marble.</p>

<p>In the next year we have the usual records of official
appointments, and as a proof of his artistic activity,
the two pictures still remaining in the little town of
Arcevia, dated 1507 and 1508, one of them, the splendid
<i>Ancona</i>, being among his finest works.</p>

<p>Now a man of nearly seventy, Signorelli's energies
seemed to grow greater with increasing age, for in
1508 we find him, besides being elected to his usual
offices, deputed as ambassador to Florence, to demand
there permission to reform the offices and ordinances
of Cortona, and in the same year he was at Rome,
together with Perugino, Pintorricchio, and Sodoma,
working at the decoration of the Vatican Chambers,
already begun by Pier dei Franceschi. Giambattista
Caporali gives a glimpse into their social life in Rome,
telling of a supper given in their honour by Bramante<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;Bramante,
to whose introduction to the Pope of the
young Raffaelle it is due that none of their work,
with the exception of Perugino's ceiling, remains to
us. How much Signorelli painted we do not know.
Vasari says, "He had successfully completed one
wall,"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but so enchanted was Julius II. with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
facile and modern style of Raffaelle, that after he had
finished the "Stanza della Segnatura," he forced him
to destroy the paintings of the older masters and
delivered the entire work to him and his assistants:
a caprice which points a very significant turn in the
history of painting&mdash;the triumph of the late Renaissance
over the giants of the past.</p>

<p>Signorelli seemed destined to find nothing but disappointment
in Rome. Five years later, an old man
of seventy-two, he again went there, this time on the
accession of Giovanni dei Medici, in 1513, to the Papal
chair. Knowing the luxurious nature of the new Pope,
and remembering the intense passion of his father
Lorenzo for art and letters, to Rome flocked poets
and painters, sculptors and architects, from every part
of Italy, in the hope of work or of reward, and among
them came Signorelli, with reasonable expectation of
employment, and notice from the son of his old patron
and friend.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Like his predecessor, however, Leo X.
preferred the more modern school of Raffaelle and his
pupils, and Luca had to return disappointed to Cortona.
In connection with the visit exists a curious document,
which has smirched too long the honour of the painter.
It is the famous letter of Michelangelo, preserved among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the Buonarotti archives, in which he makes a complaint
to the Capitano of Cortona, that Signorelli, sick with
the ingratitude of the Medici "for the love of whom he
would have had his head cut off," had borrowed of him
eighty <i>juli</i> with which to return to Cortona; that on
application for the money, Luca declared it to have
been already repaid, so that now he&mdash;Michelangelo&mdash;sees
no other way of obtaining his own but by application
to the Capitano for justice.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This is the gist
of the letter; we have to use our own knowledge of
the character of the two men to decipher the mystery,
since no other document confirms or denies the accusation.
The reasonable explanation seems to be that
some delay, probably on the road, in the transmission
of the money, irritated the notoriously impatient temper
of Michelangelo. Signorelli's character, from all we
know of it, seems to have been most upright and
generous. "Such was the goodness of his nature, that
he never lent himself to things that were not just and
righteous," says Vasari,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and that he should have been
guilty of so petty a crime towards a friend, is not for a
moment to be believed. Moreover, his will, re-made
in the following year, proves him to have been in
prosperous circumstances, while the fact that he continued
to hold his appointments, and to receive fresh
and even more honourable ones, testifies to the respect
in which he was held by his fellow-citizens. In pleasant
contrast with Michelangelo's accusation are the glimpses
we have of his stately old age, through Vasari. "And
at last," he writes, "having completed works for nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
all the princes of Italy, and being now old, he returned
to Cortona, where, in his last years, he worked more
for pleasure than any other reason, as one who,
accustomed to labour, knew not how to be idle."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Of these later paintings the "Deposition" of Umbertide
proves that the old man of seventy-five had lost
little of his power. It is one of his most beautiful
and tender renderings of a scene he has so often
painted. The "Madonna," now in the Arezzo Gallery,
painted three years later (1519), shows, perhaps, a
slight falling off in technical power, while retaining
to the full his characteristic grandeur of conception.
It was this picture which, Vasari tells us, was borne
on the shoulders of the brothers, for whose order it
was painted, from Cortona to Arezzo, and Luca, old
as he was, insisted on accompanying them, partly to
place it in position, as was customary, and partly to
revisit his friends and relations. The biographer gives
a characteristic incident in connection with this visit,
told so charmingly, that I can do no better than transcribe
it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And he, being lodged in the house of the Vasari,
where I was a little child of eight years, I remember
how that good old man, who was always gracious and
courteous, having learnt from the master who first taught
me my letters, that I cared for nothing else at school
but drawing pictures; I remember, I say, he turned
to Antonio, my father, and said to him: 'Antonio,
since Giorgio takes after his family, let him by all
means be taught how to draw, because, even if he
cares for literature, to know how to draw cannot but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
be a source of honour and enjoyment, if not of utility,
to him, as to every honourable man.' Then he turned
to me, who stood up straight before him, and said, 'Learn,
little kinsman.'" And Vasari adds, how, hearing that
he suffered much from bleeding at the nose, which
sometimes left him half dead, Signorelli hung a jasper
charm about his neck, "with infinite tenderness. Which
memory of Luca," he concludes, "will remain eternally
fixed in my soul."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;One of those delightful human
touches of which the writings of Vasari are so full.</p>

<p>This visit to Arezzo took place only four years
before his death. He must have died in 1523, at the
age of eighty-two, but there is no special record of
the event, the date being gathered only from a document,
which tells of the election on the 8th of December
of another Inspector of Santa Margherita, to fill the
place of the dead painter.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> On the 13th of October
of the same year, he had made his last will, leaving,
with many minor bequests, the bulk of his property to
his son, Pier Tommaso, and his grandson, Giulio, and
expressing his desire to be buried in the tomb of his
family in the Church of S. Francesco.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In his first
edition, Vasari tells us that, after his death, his memory
was honoured by many epitaphs, among which he
quotes the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pianga Cortona omai, vestasi oscura,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Che estinti son' del Signorello i lumi;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et tu, Pittura, fa de gli occhi fiumi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ch&egrave; resti senza lui debili e scura."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Apparently Signorelli retained his health and energy
up to the end of his long life, for only the year before
his death he had accepted fresh appointments in
Cortona, and, in addition to his old offices, was filling
those of Priore of the Fraternity of S. Mark, Sindaco
del Capitans, and several others, religious and secular.
He was, moreover, still actively painting, and in the
very year of his death he completed the altar-piece
for the Church at Foiano, a work as noble and
majestic in conception as it is vigorous in execution,
besides accepting a commission from the Priori to paint
them an altar-piece for the chapel of their palace.</p>

<p>I can do no better than conclude this scanty history
with the character of the man, as it is told us by Vasari:
"Luca was a person of excellent habits, sincere and
affectionate with his friends, sweet and agreeable in
his converse with everyone, specially courteous to those
who had need of his help, and kindly in his instructions
to his pupils. He lived most splendidly, and
delighted in dressing well. For the which good
qualities he was always, in his own country and elsewhere,
held in the highest veneration."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

like Leonardo, he combined work with luxury, but the evidence is of too
slight a nature to allow us to consider that side of his life, if it really

<h3>DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS GENIUS</h3>


<p>The foregoing chapter contains only a bare record of
certain facts in the life of Luca Signorelli. Fortunately
time has spared many of his paintings, and in
the study of these we get a fuller insight into his
nature and his aims. A man's work is, after all, the
most satisfactory and reliable document for those who
take the pains to decipher it&mdash;the autobiography which
every man of genius bequeaths to posterity.</p>

<p>We have seen how by good fortune he was placed
as a child to study painting under Pier dei Franceschi,
who was of all men most able to bring out in his pupils
the finer instincts and nobler qualities of their genius.
By his guidance and example, no doubt, Signorelli cultivated
his natural breadth of conception and of treatment,
which give grandeur and impressive solemnity
to all his works, besides acquiring the technical
excellences of good drawing, solid modelling, and
the broad massing of the shadows, which are so
characteristic of Piero's own painting. The spirit of
master and pupil was fundamentally alike, the chief
points of dissimilarity in their work arising from
minor divergences of temperament. Both were men
of robust mind, with a message of resolute purpose
to deliver. Both chose to express themselves through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the medium of the human form in its most vigorous
aspects, and were, therefore, pre-occupied with mastering
its structure. But while Piero, with a serene nature,
chose to represent unemotional figures like the sculptures
of the ancient Egyptians, the restless and impetuous
spirit of Signorelli preferred scenes of violent
action, and energetic movement.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, the entire affinity of their temperament,
as well as his passion for anatomical study,
which led him to choose his second master in a man
whose taste for realism, and interest in the action of
muscle and movement of limb was as keen as his own.
On Antonio Pollaiuolo, even more than on Pier dei
Franceschi, had fallen the mantle of Paolo Uccello's
investigating spirit. As the latter gave all his attention
to applying the laws of perspective to landscape
and figures, so the efforts of Pollaiuolo were concentrated
on giving freedom to the limbs. Great
anatomist though he was, Piero was not so ardent a
lover of the Nude for its own sake as the Florentine,
and the problems of movement have little interest
for him, whereas in the most characteristic work of
Pollaiuolo it is evident that the scenes are chosen to
display the muscles in tense prominence, and the
limbs in violent action or unusual posture.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> With
precisely the same interests in the human structure
and its movements, it is no wonder that Signorelli
caught so much of his style and mannerisms. The
influence of Antonio Pollaiuolo was stronger than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
any other in the development of his actual work, and
is visible in all his paintings up to the last in greater
or less degree, but only less important is that of
Donatello, to whom Antonio himself owed so much.
Forty years before the birth of Signorelli, Donatello
had been able to carve the human form with absolute
perfection of anatomy, and not only that, but to endow
it with freedom of limb and overflowing life. It is
easy to suppose the impression his statues must have
made on the youth, whose spirit was so much akin to
his own in exuberant energy, and who had the same
uncompromising love of realism. The two artists had
much in common in their confident self-reliance, and
almost arrogant buoyancy of nature, which was the
true Renaissance expression, and the outward sign
of its immense strength. Signorelli caught and revived
the very essence of Donatello's spirit&mdash;the love
of bodily life in its most hopeful and vigorous manifestations.
It is significant that the swaggering posture
which became such a special feature of his painting,
should have originated with Donatello. Donatello
was, before all things, a realist, and it was probably
the habitual attitude of the cavalry soldier of the
day, accustomed to straddle over the broad back of
his war-horse, but there is little doubt that it was
adopted by Signorelli from the "S. George" of Or San
Michele, and perhaps half-unconsciously signified to
him&mdash;what that statue so well embodies&mdash;the confident
spirit of youth and strength. In his portrait of Pippo
Spana, now in S. Apollonia, Florence, Andrea di
Castagno also imitated and emphasised it, as also
did Botticelli in his carved background of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
"Calumny," and Perugino in many of his paintings.
But Botticelli's painted statue and Perugino's "S.
Michael" and "Warriors" of the Cambio seem to spread
their legs because they are too puny to bear the
weight of the body in any other manner, while with
Signorelli, the attitude became the keynote of his
resolute indomitable nature, and so much a part of
his work, that one is apt to forget it did not originate
with him.</p>

<p>Although the character and aims of the two men are
so entirely different, yet to Perugino, Signorelli owed
much in his methods of producing the feeling of free
space, and the life and movement of the atmosphere.
Perugino's greatest gift to Art was this power of
rendering the magic of the sun-warmed air and the
sense of illimitable distance. He gave to his landscapes
space and depth, the gentle stir of wind, and
the golden shimmer of sunshine. Signorelli also learnt
this power of presenting the life of hill and tree and
sky, and some of his effects of distance have the space
and grandeur almost of Nature herself. He also, like
Perugino, could detach his figures from the background,
and send the line of hills receding back to the horizon.
Signorelli owes to him, besides, certain superficial
characteristics, such as the fluttering scarfs and ribbon-like
draperies, and the upturned face with ecstatic
eyes which belongs to the Umbrian painter as much
as the drooping head belongs to Botticelli.</p>

<p>From these four great artists Signorelli learnt what
each had best to give, and assimilated and made it
his own, with unerring instinct for its virtue in aiding
his own specific qualities. Not that he was in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
sense an eclectic, but he had the unconscious tendency
of the healthy soul to seize upon the food that best
ministers to its nourishment. Thus the fine genius
and inspiration of Pier dei Franceschi and the grace
of Perugino saved him from becoming too rigorously
realistic under the influence of the scientific Florentines,
Donatello and Pollaiuolo, working upon his own uncompromising
nature.</p>

<p>The most important writers on Signorelli&mdash;Crowe
and Cavalcaselle,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Rumohr,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and, above all, Vischer,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
mention several other masters, who, they claim, exercised
an influence upon his work, and it is obvious
that to the Sienese school generally he was indebted
for many decorative methods, particularly in the use
of gold and gilded gesso. There are also in some of
his paintings reminiscences of Verrocchio and Fiorenzo
di Lorenzo; but an impression of sufficient depth to
be considered, must touch the spirit, and here there
appears to me to be little besides superficial resemblances.
It must be remembered, moreover, in
the case of Verrocchio, how much he himself owed to
Donatello, while with respect to the asserted influence
of Pintorricchio, it is more probable that what likeness
there is in their style should testify to the impression
of the stronger upon the weaker nature. With Andrea
di Castagno his work, both in outward form and in
spirit, has something in common; and no doubt
Signorelli was impressed by paintings which themselves
show so much the influence of Donatello.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have seen, Luca's chief interest, like that of
Pollaiuolo, lay in the effort to render movement of
limb with facility, and therefore his attention was
concentrated on the muscles and their action. We
do not know how long he studied anatomy from the
dead and living model in the Florentine workshop,
nor have we any example of his gradual development,
for when he first appears before us in his earliest
remaining work, "The Flagellation," of the Brera, he
is already the master who has conquered all the
difficulties of muscular movement, and surpassed even
Antonio Pollaiuolo in freedom of gesture and correct
anatomy.</p>

<p>It is not till later, however, that the most important
advance he made on previous painting first begins to
show itself&mdash;the power, namely, of rendering combined
action, of working the limbs of a crowd into a single
movement. This is Signorelli's special achievement,
on the merits of which he takes rank with the most
important masters of the Quattrocento as a pioneer
and teacher. Great as was Pollaiuolo's command over
gesture and action, it was limited to the combination
of two figures only,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> while with Signorelli the action
of the single figure is held subordinate to that of
the multitude. He gives the stately march of an
army, as in the Umbertide predella and the Monte
Oliveto fresco; the writhings of innumerable figures,
like heaps of coiled serpents, as in the "Damnation"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of Orvieto; the rush of a violent mob stirred by a
common impulse, as in the Florence and Cortona
"Betrayals." This command over united movement
was new in painting, though, like all other difficulties,
it had been already mastered by Donatello, as we
see in his romping children of the Prato pulpit, and
the Florence Cantoria, to name only two examples.
Botticelli, who, with so different a nature, had yet, in
common with the robust Signorelli, this passion for
swift movement, achieved later, it is true, almost as
great triumphs<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; but to Luca belongs the merit of
having endowed painting with the same freedom of
combined movement which Donatello had given to
sculpture.</p>

<p>Unlike Botticelli, he is consistently a lover of energy
all through his life, and as the source of energy, of
strength, and vigorous health. His grand conception
of the body is one of the chief characteristics of his
work. Strong and stately, it is a fit receptacle for the
spirit of resolution and self-confidence with which he
animates it. His Virgins are like goddesses, and seem
to typify for him the strength of womanhood. Nowhere
do we see nobler beauty than in his angels and
archangels. In these "divine birds"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he seems to
have recognised the ideal of all he strove for, and
their wings are symbols to him of swift movement and
superhuman strength. It was always strength that
attracted him, and strength conscious of its own force,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
finding its expression in exuberant animation. Thus
he loves to paint the swaggering soldiers, whose
attitudes express their audacious self-reliance. He
gives the luxuriant life of Nature as no one else gave
it, and his trees and plants are as robust and unyielding
as his firmly-planted figures. His angels' wings are
not merely decorative, but have real power of muscle
under the plumes to lift the body and bear it aloft
without fatigue.</p>

<p>He was a lover of beauty, but it was not for beauty
he strove, or we should not so often find bits of
realistic ugliness to risk the harmony of his noblest
paintings. Grace and charm seemed to come to him
unsought, as natural adjuncts of a vigorous and healthy
nature; but his deliberate choice of types of face and
form, were those which, by their strength, promised
satisfaction to his love of energetic action. From the first
this tendency is noticeable, for example, in the above-mentioned
"Flagellation," and the Loreto "Conversion
of Saul," and goes on increasing until it reaches a
climax in the frescoes of Orvieto.</p>

<p>Once one has grasped the main motive of Signorelli's
work, his preoccupation with movement, and consequently
with the muscles, his frequent defects and
inequalities in other respects become, as faults of inattention,
less incomprehensible. For example, his
values of distance are often faulty, and give the unpleasant
sensation that one figure is standing on the
top of another,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> a defect of carelessness, for no one
is a better master of aerial perspective when he chooses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Again, his hands and feet are often incorrectly drawn
and badly modelled, but it is only when they are not
essential to the action; for although the drawing of
hands and feet is always perhaps his weakest point,
yet even in his early painting of the "Flagellation" he
has already mastered some of their greatest difficulties
of foreshortening. The recognition of the intention
in a man's work enables one to dispense with much
adverse criticism in detail. It would be wearisome to
reiterate the faults of drawing in each picture when
we come to deal with them separately, and it is better
to recognise in the outset that, in pursuit of a certain
definite end, Signorelli is careless of what seems
to him unessential at the moment.</p>

<p>Thus in dealing with him as a colourist<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> we have
to bear in mind that it was by line and modelling
chiefly that his effects of movement were obtained.
To be over-critical of the shortcomings of his colour,
therefore, would be as foolish as to miss the charm of
Bonifazio's splendid harmonies in abuse of some defect
of drawing. Sometimes, in fact, Signorelli gains his
end by the very crudeness and heaviness for which
he is generally condemned, the sharp contrasts giving
a rugged strength to his painting, and the copper
colour of the flesh adding robustness to the figures.</p>

<p>It would, however, be most unjust to speak as if
his colour were always, or even usually, crude and
harsh. On the contrary, in landscape it is invariably
beautiful; and he uses certain golden and moss-greens
in foliage and grass, and a limpid greenish-blue in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
water, which are most harmonious. Sometimes it is
gorgeous, and in nearly all his early paintings there
is a beauty of red and soft green, and a warmth of
golden glow of great depth and tenderness. He had,
perhaps, a tendency to the use of too heavy colour,
especially in the flesh; and he himself seems aware of
it, for, in middle life, for a brief time, he changed his
tone to an almost silvery lightness, with very pale
flesh-tints, as in the Uffizi "Holy Family," No. 1291,
and again, after working at Orvieto, in the "Dead
Christ supported by Angels," of S. Niccol&ograve;, Cortona,
whose general colour is almost like honey; but he
relapses always into his characteristic dark tones,
especially in the works of his old age, which are for
the most part heavy and rather harsh, with flesh-tints
of the reddish-brown of terra-cotta.</p>

<p>It is, as I have said, by form rather than colour
that Signorelli obtains his best effects. He is a superb
linealist, as the often-quoted "Flagellation" shows, and
one is inclined to wish he had oftener used outline,
as here, in the manner of Pier dei Franceschi. His
line is firm and clear, simple and structural, of unerring
sweep and accuracy, as we see in his numerous <i>predella</i>
paintings; but even more remarkable is the wonderful
plastic quality of his modelling. By this he makes
us realise better than any one before him the tenseness
of sinew, the resistance of hard muscle, and the
supple elasticity of flesh, giving a solidity and weight
to his forms that make them impressive as grand
sculptures.</p>

<p>As an illustrator Signorelli is most unequal; brilliant
and dramatic when the subject appealed to his taste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
as in the Orvieto frescoes, often weak, as in his treatment
of sacred themes. He was essentially a religious
painter, but in the widest meaning of the word, and
he does not seem to have felt the dignity and significance
of many of the scenes in the life of Christ.
When he has to paint Him bound to the pillar or
nailed to the Cross, submissive to scourging and insult,
his interest seems to wander from what should be
the central figure, and fixes itself on some two or
three of the minor actors, to whom he gives the
importance he should have concentrated on the Christ.
The painter <i>con amore</i> of arrogant strength, he seems
to have little in common with meekness and humility
that bows the head to scourging and martyrdom.
Thus in nearly all his "Crucifixions" the central
figure is ignoble in type and expression, and in the
"Flagellations" of the Brera and of Morra, is entirely
without dignity, even ignominious. This is curious
when we consider that even more than of arrogant
strength Signorelli was the painter of stately and noble
beauty.</p>

<p>Again it seems as if he cared only to represent
figures of powerful maturity, for there is a complete
lack of sympathy in his painting of children. With
one or two exceptions, his child Christs are half-animal
little beings, more like tiny satyrs than human
children, although not without a certain pathos in
their very ugliness. In a picture of as great beauty and
tender feeling as the "Holy Family," of the Rospigliosi
Collection, for example, the child is more animal than
human. Unlike Donatello, who delights in childhood,
and sees in it the bubbling source of future strength,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Signorelli gives his babies the overweighted, unelastic
sadness of old age. In composing his Holy Families,
therefore, his attention is centred on the Virgin, the
strong woman he loved to paint, but the child he seems
to feel as an accessory to be executed because the
Church has ordered it, and so he puts it in without
thought of all it meant and typified.</p>

<p>But although he sometimes falls short as an interpreter
of the Church's intention, the impressive grandeur of his
work is in itself intensely religious, and he makes us
feel most solemnly the dignity of Nature, and especially
of the human form. Once he was stirred into something
of the Pagan spirit, probably under the influence
of the court of Lorenzo, and he touched the real note
of Pantheism in the "Pan," of the Berlin Gallery, and
the noble figures in the background of the Uffizi and
Munich "Madonnas." In these the spiritual mood
dominates and is sustained throughout, and there is
no sign of the scientific absorption which sometimes
in his treatment of the nude makes us too aware of
the student and the realist. One is at times conscious
that, painting straight from the life, Signorelli's interest
lay chiefly in a faithful reproduction of the body
before him. His dead Christs for example, were
obviously copied exactly as the corpses lay or hung
in his studio. The S. Onofrio of the Perugia altar-piece,
stood just so, a half-starved street-beggar, with baggy
skin over rheumatic joints. The angel in the same
picture, chosen perhaps for its grace of face, must be
reproduced exactly as the child sat, with weak legs
and ungainly body. Each figure is a truthful study
from life, and it was that which interested the painter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and not that he was representing saints and angels
whose noble beauty was supposed to elevate the mind
to a state of worship.</p>

<p>Yet with all his realistic treatment, he was intensely
alive to the graces of decoration, both in general lines
and in detail. In the frescoes of Loreto, and more
particularly of Orvieto, the mere scheme of decoration
is superb, and adds beauty and distinction to every
subtle line of the architecture. He pays attention,
also, to the minor details of decorative effect, and takes
pains with the ornaments and embroideries; while his
use of gold, and embossing with gesso, add much to
the &aelig;sthetic charm of his work, and proves that he
could, when necessary, subordinate his love of realism
to his sense of beauty.</p>

<p>Before summing up the chief qualities of Signorelli's
work, I must not omit one characteristic which points
to the strength of his personality&mdash;the way he repeats
his own types (and not types only, but precisely the
same forms) time after time, and often after the lapse of
many years. The child Christs he paints over and over
again, the same figure, sometimes exactly in the same
attitude, as in the "Madonnas," of the Florence
Academy and of the Brera. The seated burly Bishop of
the Loreto vaulting (one of his earliest works) occurs
again in the Volterra "Madonna," and again (painted
many years later) in the "Madonna," of the Florence
Academy. Line for line he reproduces the figure of
Echo, out of the early "Pan," into the fresco of "The
Crowning of the Elect," at Orvieto. In one or two
cases he boldly repeats the same figure in the same
picture, feature for feature, as in the Virgin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
S. John of the Rospigliosi "Holy Family," limb for limb
as in the flying soldiers of the Loreto "Conversion
of Saul."</p>

<p>He was also most faithful to his own type of limb
or feature, especially those in which Morelli has taught
us always to look for similarity. The fleshy ear, with
its slightly pointed top, is nearly invariable, as also is
the broad hand with its little outlined nails and thick
wrists.</p>

<p>In glancing rapidly over the whole of Signorelli's
work, consistency to an absorbing interest is the note
struck again and again. He has set himself from the
first a task&mdash;the mastery of the human structure and
its movements; and with the resolution and perseverance
of a strong nature, he never swerves from his
purpose. This is the conscious aim and intention of
the artist. What he was able to give to the world,
of nobility and dignity&mdash;a wider and healthier conception
of Nature and her power and beauty&mdash;was the
Message of his Genius, of which he was himself unconscious,
but which spoke all the more forcibly for
the learning acquired by hard application and earnest
effort. In a detailed study of his painting, it may be
that the student of anatomy and the realist often
assert themselves, but as grand figure after grand
figure has passed before the mind, the general impression
is solemn and ennobling. "To no other
contemporary painter," says Morelli, "was it given to
endow the human frame with the like degree of
passion, vehemence and strength."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> To this we may
add that no other painter has ever conceived Humanity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with the same stately grandeur and in the same
broad spirit. The confident strength of youth, the
stern austerity of middle life, the resolute solemnity
of old age&mdash;these are his themes. Signorelli is, before
all, the painter of the dignity of human life.</p>

<h3>EARLIEST WORKS</h3>


<p>One of the most remarkable things in the history
of Signorelli's work, considering what a number
of his paintings remain, is that only two of them can
be placed with any degree of certainty as having been
executed before his fortieth year. These two are the
"Madonna" (No. 281), and "The Flagellation" (No.
262), in the Brera Gallery, Milan. This last, however&mdash;"The
Flagellation"&mdash;indicates in what manner
much of his earlier time had been employed, for
although betraying in parts a certain youthful immaturity,
yet the skilful drawing and thorough comprehension
of anatomy shown in the nudes, especially
in the backs of the two executioners, reveals already
the practised hand of a master of his craft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Brera, Milan</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE FLAGELLATION</p>
</div>

<p>The best studies of the nude remaining to us by
earlier painters, are the figures in "The Death of
Adam," by Pier dei Franceschi, in his frescoes at
Arezzo, the "Hercules overcoming Ant&aelig;us," and "The
Battle of the Nudes," by Antonio Pollaiuolo, in the
Uffizi Gallery. It is sufficient to compare with these
the freer rendering of gesture, and the greater accuracy
of the anatomy in Signorelli's executioners, to see what
an advance he had already made upon any previous
painting. (I limit, of course, this assertion to painting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
only, for in sculpture Donatello had years before given
free gesture and perfect anatomy to his statues.) It
would be impossible to overrate the excellence and
beauty of drawing in the splendid swing of the bodies,
the flexibility of the limbs, the sinewy elasticity of the
leg muscles, and above all, the subtle suggestion of
muscular movement under the loose skin of the backs.
There is here, even more than in his later painting, an
appreciation of the relative values of the muscles, and a
consequent breadth of modelling, which he lost somewhat,
by over-accentuation, in his subsequent treatment
of the nude. The inequalities of the picture betray
wherein lay the painter's chief interest, for to this
skilful mastery of the difficulties of anatomy are opposed
the rather childish conception of the Pilate and the
stiff action of all the clothed figures. His apprenticeship
to Pier dei Franceschi is here sufficiently proved, not
so much by any likeness of colour or of composition
to "The Flagellations," of that master, in Urbino
and Borgo San Sepolero, as in the firm, clear outlining
of the nude figures, their solid modelling, and in the
broad massing of the shadows.</p>

<p>Even more apparent is the influence of Antonio
Pollaiuolo, in the great realism with which the subject
is treated, and in such superficial resemblances as the
type of head of the executioner who binds the hands of
Christ, and the characteristic striped loin-cloths.</p>

<p>The Christ is one of Signorelli's most ignoble presentations
of the Saviour, and yet it seems as though he
had tried to give graces which should harmonise with
a certain conception of the character&mdash;the hair, for
example, is the beautiful rippling hair of a woman, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
bent head and downcast eyes represent the gentleness
of resignation, and the attitude of the legs is intended to
be graceful. But the effort to curb his own natural
instinct for pride and strength makes him strike a false
note, and his attempt to give the beauty of meekness
has resulted only in producing a mask of hypocritical
inertia.</p>

<p>The picture was painted for the Church of Santa
Maria del Mercato in Fabriano, and this, as well as
the fact of its being precisely the same size, and
with the same curved top, seems to argue that it
formed originally one picture with the Madonna, No.
281 of the same gallery, whose <i>provenance</i> is also from
that church. Here the Virgin sits,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> clad in a gold
garment and blue green-lined mantle, with the Child
on her knee, and floating round her dark-green cherubs'
heads. She is the powerful type of woman, from which
in his Virgins Signorelli never departed, but in this case
with a rather cow-like expression, which gave place later
to a tender or noble dignity. The face of the Child has
lost its original character through repainting, but the
cherubs' heads surrounding the throne, have the overweighted,
half-animal expression of which I have
already spoken as characteristic of his children.</p>

<p>Next in order, as far as can be judged by the internal
evidence of the painting, come the frescoes in the
sacristy of the church of the Santa Casa at Loreto.
They were finished some time before 1484, and bear
very marked traces of Florentine impressions. Of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Vasari writes: "In Santa Maria di Loreto, he painted
in the sacristy in fresco, the four Evangelists, the four
Doctors, and other Saints, which are very beautiful;
and for this work he was liberally rewarded by Pope
Sixtus."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This is a mistake, for the patron of the
church was Cardinal Girolamo Basso della Rovere, and
the presence of his coat-of-arms in the centre of the
cupola is evidence that the work was executed at his
expense.</p>

<p>In each of the eight compartments of this roof is
painted a standing angel, playing or tuning musical
instruments&mdash;most graceful and beautiful figures. Below
are seated the four Evangelists and four Fathers of the
Church, against a gold background, who seem, in their
impressive grandeur to be prototypes of the prophets
and sybils of Michelangelo's Sistine frescoes. I do not
agree with Vischer in seeing the hand of Bartolommeo
della Gatta in the angels. They show much of the
influence of Pollaiuolo, and seem to me to be Signorelli's
unassisted work. The face and gesture of one of them
especially&mdash;the angel in the flowered robe playing a lute&mdash;is
almost a duplicate of the child on the <i>gradino</i> of the
throne in the Perugia altar-piece. The bishop in the
compartment next this angel is repeated in the Volterra
"Madonna and Saints," and in that of the Florence
Academy.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Santa Casa, Loreto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">APOSTLES</p>
</div>

<p>In the divisions of the walls under the roof are
painted the twelve Apostles, grand and stately figures,
standing two in each compartment, divided by imitation
pilasters, and forming a magnificent frieze round the
walls. The draperies are exceedingly broadly painted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and this breadth of treatment and the boldness of the
design gives importance to the figures. There being
seven compartments to be filled, in two of them
Signorelli has introduced the figure of Christ, treated
this time with dignity, perhaps because here He is
represented as the Master, and not the "Man of
Sorrows." In one He reproves S. Peter (?), who
turns away with conscience-stricken humility very
nobly rendered; in the other He shows the marks of
the Passion to the incredulous Thomas. These two
are perhaps the finest of the series, and are, besides,
dramatic in gesture and expression. The composition
of the last is, with evident intention, borrowed from
Verrocchio's group on the walls of Or San Michele,
Florence, but the likeness ends with the general lines
of composition. Vischer makes a strong point of this,
as a proof of Verrocchio's influence on Signorelli,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but
to me it seems that feeling, types of face, and especially
the broad and simple treatment of the draperies are
entirely different.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Santa Casa, Loreto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE INCREDULITY OF S. THOMAS</p>
</div>

<p>The most important of these frescoes, however, as
best illustrating Signorelli's own peculiar tendencies, is
"The Conversion of Saul," in the compartment over the
door. He has realised the scene with emotion, and
rendered it with a most convincing dramatic power,
giving the suddenness of the fall of the principal figure,
and the excitement and panic-stricken terror of the
soldiers, with wonderful truth and animation. It is
interesting to note the almost exact repetition of the
same figure in the two soldiers who hurry away to the
left, but it is not at all mechanical, and in no way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
detracts from the excellence of the composition. Very
Pollaiuolesque is the figure with raised shield in the
foreground to the right, and one feels the influence of
Perugino in the spacious empty distance of the background,
from which the figures are so well detached.</p>

<p class="caption center">THE CONVERSION OF SAUL</p>
</div>

<p>As decoration these frescoes are exceedingly fine, the
grand row of figures, besides the stately strength of
each separate group, being most impressive in general
effect. They have been much damaged. For many
years used as a sacristy, the greasy smoke of the
incense had so blackened the walls that the frescoes
were nearly invisible. The skilful cleaning of Signor
Guiseppe Missaghi, at the instigation of Signor
Cavalcaselle, has restored to them much of their original
beauty, although the colour still remains somewhat
obscured.</p>

<p>On the roof of the nave, in the church itself, are
painted a series of frescoes in <i>grisaille</i>, twenty-six
Prophets and Fathers of the Church, somewhat over
life size, seated one in each medallion. They are
solemn and impressive figures like those in the sacristy,
and painted on the same broad lines, and remind one
strongly of the two medallions, also in <i>grisaille</i>, in the
"Madonna," of the Uffizi Corridor. All of them have
severely suffered from repainting.</p>

<p>"The Adoration of the Magi," formerly in the Campana
Gallery, Rome, now No. 389 of the Louvre, seems to
have been painted in 1482. Crowe and Cavalcaselle<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
rightly consider its execution to be the work of assistants,
by reason of the rawness of colour and general coarseness
of the painting; yet in composition, and in many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the figures, there is so much of the master's impressive
dignity, that I feel compelled to regard the drawing, in
parts at least, as his own. The stately Madonna, and
the noble figure of the King on her right, whose
draperies have the same sweeping breadth as those in
the National Gallery, "Circumcision," as well as the
solid, well-seated figures of the mounted attendants, seem
to be Signorelli's own composing. The Child is also
characteristic, and resembles that in the <i>Tondo</i> of the
Pitti Gallery. The badly-drawn horses, again, seem his,
for it will be noticed all through his work that he has
never cared to thoroughly master their form, and paints
them always with curious mannerisms of too closely-placed
nostrils, and human eyebrows, which show how
little attention he had given to their anatomy.</p>

<p>The first dated picture remaining is the altar-piece of
the Perugia Cathedral, painted in 1484, of which Vasari
writes: "Also in Perugia he painted many works; and
among others in the Cathedral, for Messer Jacopo
Vannucci of Cortona, Bishop of the city, a picture in
which is Our Lady, Sant Onofrio, Sant Ercolano, S.
John Baptist, S. Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and an angel, most beautiful,
who tunes a lute."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The inscription with the date
(given in the catalogue) are unfortunately hidden by
the frame. This is one of Signorelli's finest altar-pieces,
the colour being especially rich and harmonious, and it
shows, even more than the Loreto frescoes, the strength
of Florentine influences. For example, very close to
Pollaiuolo is the figure of the angel tuning the lute,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with its striped scarf, and so also is the powerful head
of S. Ercolano. The S. Stephen is almost a reproduction
of the bust of S. Lorenzo by Donatello in the
sacristy of the church of that saint in Florence, the
aged S. Onofrio again recalls his wooden statue of S.
Jerome in Faenza, and finally the motive of the cut
flowers in glasses is borrowed from the triptych of Hugo
van der Goes in the Gallery of Santa Maria Nuova,
Florence. The ornamental accessories are singularly
fine and careful in finish, and it would seem as though
Signorelli had been inspired in this, not only by the
great tryptych, but also by the followers of the Paduan
Squarcione. In the last chapter I have pointed out
the extreme realism with which the figures are treated,
but this does not spoil the impressive grandeur of
the painting, gained by the broad style and the stately
simplicity of the composition. The Virgin sits firmly,
with the mantle resting in heavy folds across her
knees; the S. Stephen is overflowing with the vigorous
life of youth; the splendidly-draped bishop is
a powerful and majestic figure; and there is real
tenderness and grace in the face of the angel, notwithstanding
the want of symmetry in the body and
legs. The painting has suffered from restoration, but on
the whole is fairly well preserved, and may be seen to
advantage in the quiet of this well-lighted winter-chapel.</p>

<p>Crowe and Cavalcaselle place "The Circumcision," of
the National Gallery, formerly in Volterra, as about the
same date as the foregoing;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Vischer, presuming that it
was painted at the same time with the dated pictures of
1491 still remaining in Volterra, groups it with them;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
but the similarity of colour and treatment lead me to
accept the former theory. The distance from Cortona
to Volterra is not very great, and the fact that he was
painting there in 1491 does not preclude the possibility
of his having painted there six or seven years before,
even if it was executed on the spot, which was not by
any means always the case. At all events the picture
has much in common with the Perugia altar-piece, both
in warmth of colour, simplicity of composition and
splendid breadth of execution. The painting of this
"Circumcision" is bold and resolute, the draperies
sweep in broad folds round the figures. The attitude of
the standing woman to the right is grand, and the
earnest concentration of the faces on the ceremony, and
the absence of any connecting link between them and
us, give dramatic reality to the scene. Vasari writes of
it: "At Volterra he painted in fresco"&mdash;(a mistake&mdash;it
is his usual oil medium)&mdash;"in the church of S.
Francesco, above the altar of the brotherhood, the
Circumcision of our Lord, which is considered marvellously
beautiful; although the Child, having suffered
from the damp, was repainted by Sodoma much less
beautiful than it was before."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This unfortunate repainting,
which has also evidently included part of the
Virgin's face, was more probably due to the monks'
dislike of Signorelli's type of child than to any damage
by weather, for it would be strange that a picture, otherwise
so well preserved, should be injured by damp
nowhere but in the part most protected by reason of its
central position. To support this theory, under the
painting by Sodoma may be clearly seen (in the painting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>&mdash;not
in the photograph) the original legs of the Child
of Signorelli, in a totally different position, showing that
Sodoma had made no attempt to keep to the drawing.
The monks, no doubt, preferred the more commonplace
infant of Sodoma, but we, while acknowledging that the
children of Signorelli are far from what they should be,
may regret the loss, as did Vasari, who adds this
comment: "It would be better to retain the work of
excellent men, even though half spoiled, than to have it
repainted by one who knows less."</p>

<p class="caption center">THE CIRCUMCISION</p>
</div>

<p>A very important group of paintings apparently of
about this date, bear the impress of the classic tastes of
the Court of Lorenzo dei Medici, for whom they seem to
have been painted. It comprises the great picture of
"Pan," in the Berlin Gallery, the "Madonna," of the
Uffizi Corridor, and the Munich <i>Tondo</i>. I have been
tempted to give them a much earlier place, in the gap
before the Perugia altar-piece, because they show so
much of the idealism and idyllic spirit, which seem
properly to belong to youth, but a careful comparison of
them with that picture and the Loreto frescoes, reveals
a greater maturity of technique which makes so early a
placing not very probable. In all these three paintings
there is an appreciation of beauty for its own sake, and
a true touch of the Pantheistic spirit, combined with a
melancholy grandeur, which is most impressive.</p>

<p>The finest of the three, the great canvas of "Pan,"
now in the Berlin Gallery, is the picture of which
Vasari wrote: "He painted for Lorenzo dei Medici,
on canvas, some nude gods, which were much praised
... and presented to the said Lorenzo."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
called the "School of Pan," it is more poetically
described in the German catalogue "Pan, as God of
Natural Life, and Master of Music, with his Attendants."
It is full of poetry, and of idyllic charm
with all its stately solemnity. The sad beauty of the
god as he listens to the music of the pipes, the golden
sunlight on the moss-green grass, the quiet peace
of the scene, have an entrancing effect, and we are
transported in spirit to the same "melodious plot of
beechen green and shadows numberless" where Pan
holds his court.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Gallery, Berlin</i></p>
<p class="caption center">PAN</p>
</div>

<p>The bronze-coloured body of the god is magnificently
modelled, with a solidity unequalled even in
the Orvieto frescoes. The style of Pollaiuolo is noticeable,
in the attitude of the youth lying at his feet,
particularly in the treatment of the legs. The figure
of Echo is repeated later in "The Crowning of the
Elect," in Orvieto, though there it has lost much of
the idyllic charm of this wood-nymph. The grouping
of the figures is perhaps less happy than usual, but
this time the bad values of distance are no doubt
due to the rough treatment the painting has undergone.
It has indeed had an eventful history. About
thirty years ago it was found by the late Signor Tricca,
a noted restorer of pictures, in the attics of the Palazzo
Corsi, Florence. He hesitated at first to recognise it
certainly as the work of Signorelli, for all the figures
were covered from head to foot with draperies of
obviously eighteenth-century painting. On trial,
however, he found that these were easily removed, and
as the nude figures were revealed, he at once identified
it as the picture of the nude gods, mentioned by Vasari.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
It seems that it had passed into the possession of the
Rinuccini family as part of the dowry of one of the
Medici, and on the marriage of one of the ladies of
the Rinuccini with a Marchese Corsi again formed
part of the bride's portion. Soon after its discovery
and restoration the Marchese Corsi died, and his
brother Cardinal Corsi inherited the property. Objecting
to the picture on account of the nude figures,
he desired Signor Tricca to sell it, and it was then
bought by Mr H. J. Ross, who offered it to the English
National Gallery. On the refusal of the authorities
to purchase it, it was acquired in 1873 by Dr Bode
for the Berlin Gallery, of which it is one of the greatest
treasures.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It has naturally suffered much from the
process of cleaning away the later draperies, and much
of the under-painting is exposed, but enough remains
of its original beauty to rank it as the best of
Signorelli's easel pictures.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly of the same date is the "Madonna,"
No. 74 of the Uffizi Gallery. This picture was, also,
according to Vasari, painted as a present for Lorenzo
dei Medici, and was for many years in the villa of
Duke Cosimo at Castello. It has the same idyllic
beauty in the background as the "Pan," and is painted
in the same half-pagan spirit. The Virgin, it is true,
sits awkwardly, and with a rather ungainly gesture of
hands and arms, there are faults of drawing in the
feet, and the Child is ugly and insignificant. But
these are faults easy to overlook in considering the
grandeur of the landscape, the beauty of the colour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and, above all, the magnificent modelling of the nude
figures in the background. The Virgin gains in
importance by the nobility of these athletes behind
her, but it is clear that Signorelli's interest lay less
in the melancholy Mother and Child, than in these
superb Titans, in whom he seems to have personified
the forces of Nature. How great was the influence of
this picture upon Michelangelo we need only take a
few steps into the Tribuna to see, in his <i>Tondo</i> of
the Holy Family, No. 1139. The painting is set in
a kind of frame in <i>grisaille</i>, surmounted by a head
of S. John the Baptist, and two seated Prophets in
medallions.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Uffizi, Florence</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MADONNA</p>
</div>

<p>Somewhat inferior in execution, but painted in
exactly the same spirit, is the "Madonna," of the
Munich Gallery, formerly in the Palazzo Ginori,
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Here, as in the last, the Virgin sits, filling
the foreground space, a stately figure, with fingers
pressed together, as if in prayer to the Child at her
feet. The background is a classic landscape, through
which runs a stream of the beautiful limpid green
with which Signorelli always paints water, and by its
side sits another of the noble nude figures, untying
his sandal. It may be intended for S. John the Baptist,
as the critics say, but I do not think that either here
or in the Uffizi painting, Signorelli had any intention
of adhering to traditional illustration. It seems rather
as though the pictures were symbolic&mdash;expressive of
some comparison in his mind between Christianity, as
he perhaps conceived it for the moment, melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and dejected, and the Greek Pantheism, vigorous and
strong, and radiant with the joy of life.</p>

<p>Another picture belonging to this beautiful group
is the "Portrait of a Man," in the Berlin Gallery,
formerly in the Torrigiani Collection, Florence. In
the days before it was photographed it was considered
to be a portrait of Signorelli himself, and, as it represents
a man with grey hair, was naturally reckoned
among his later works; but comparison with the two
portraits at Orvieto show that there is no real resemblance
of feature, while the technique and spirit
of the painting claim a place for it among this early
series.</p>

<p>Here again occur the classic figures, but this time
with less of the idyllic feeling. On one side are
hurrying Apollo and Daphne(?), on the other, one
athlete has overthrown another, and stands menacingly
over his prey, who tries with ineffectual gestures to
beat him off&mdash;a very Pollaiuolesque scene of violence.
The colouring, with its clear reds of the <i>biretta</i> and
the robe, is very successful. With this powerful portrait
closes this beautiful and interesting group of paintings,
the <i>provenance</i> of all four of which, it will be observed,
is from Florence.</p>

<p>The two <i>Tondos</i>, of the Pitti and Corsini Galleries,
Florence, must have been painted at a date not far
distant from those, for they have much in common in
certain forms, and particularly in the rich and glowing
scheme of colour.</p>

<p>The "Holy Family," of the Pitti Gallery, has been
restored, and suffers much from thick varnish and
repainting, but nothing has spoilt the harmony of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the colours, nor the tender beauty of the Virgin,
whose features and expression are a repetition of
those of Echo in the "Pan." The Saint, who writes
at the dictation of the Child, is painted with earnestness,
and the whole scene is treated with the utmost
religious feeling.</p>

<p>The "Madonna and Saints," of the Corsini Gallery,
has the same warm glow of colour, and was probably
painted about the same time. The Virgin sits with
the Child on her left knee, clad in a red robe, round
the neck of which little Loves are embroidered in
gold. Over it she wears a dark-green mantle shot
with gold&mdash;a form of decoration very usual with
Signorelli, especially about this time. She has the
beautiful, pale, honey-coloured hair which occurs so
often in his works, almost the same colour which was
characteristic of Palma's Venetian ladies later. To
the left kneels S. Jerome, gazing up at her, and on
the right is S. Bernard holding a pen and book. The
painting is in a good state of preservation.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Pitti, Florence</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MADONNA AND SAINTS</p>
</div>

<p>The rather insignificant type of head of S. Joseph
occurs again in another "Holy Family," which belongs
approximately to the same period,&mdash;that of the
Rospigliosi Gallery in Rome. As far as beauty and
tender grace go, this is the most successful of all his
Madonnas. The daring repetition of the same features
with darker colouring in the S. John behind her, I
have already drawn attention to. The draperies are
painted with great freedom, and a fine sweep of broad
fold. They are shot, as in the Corsini <i>Tondo</i>, with
gold in the high lights. Insignificant as is the Child
in all these Holy Families, there is at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
time something pathetic and winning in the earnest,
careworn little face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<img src="images/i068.jpg" width="432" height="655" alt="HOLY FAMILY" title="" />
<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Rospigliosi Gallery, Rome</i></p>
<p class="caption center">HOLY FAMILY</p>
</div>

<p>Very different is the type Signorelli has adopted
for the Christ in the Uffizi "Holy Family," No. 1291,
which must be placed somewhere about this time, or
a very little later. Here He is represented with a
certain nobility of feature and gesture, although self-conscious
and unchildlike. The Greek profile of the
Virgin is almost identical with that of the above-mentioned
Rospigliosi picture, while the powerful
head of S. Joseph carries us back to the figures in
the "Circumcision." The Virgin sits uneasily, ill-balanced,
and with badly-modelled feet, but the
beauty of the face makes amends for these defects.
It is a picture full of noble qualities, both of feeling
and technique, and it has besides a special importance
by reason of the difference of colour, so much
less heavy than usual. The flesh tints are very pale,
and the shadows a silvery grey, and the whole tone
is much lighter than in any of the preceding pictures.
The composition is specially fine, the attention being
concentrated without effort on the central figure of the
Child, to which the other two serve as a kind of frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Uffizi, Florence</i></p>
<p class="caption center">HOLY FAMILY</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot leave this series of early works, which
includes so many <i>Tondos</i>, without drawing attention
to the excellence of Signorelli's composition in
this difficult form. The figures fill the space naturally
and without any artificial bending of the heads to fit
the shape; there is a sense of space, and ease of
grouping, and the large sweeping lines of the draperies
follow most harmoniously the curves of the panel.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Perugia altar-piece, none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the above-mentioned paintings are dated. Inferentially
we arrive at the time when the Loreto frescoes
were completed, but there is little to help in grouping
the rest beyond the internal evidence they afford.
I have endeavoured to place them in the order they
seem most naturally to take, with reference to colour,
form, and the early influences to be observed in them,
but the arrangement must necessarily be somewhat
arbitrary.</p>

<p>Fortunately this difficulty grows less and less in
dealing with the later works, and the most important
of them are generally dated.</p>

<h3>MIDDLE PERIOD</h3>


<p>We have now arrived at the paintings belonging
to the year 1491, part of which Signorelli
spent in Volterra, three works still remaining in
that city to testify to the visit&mdash;"The Annunciation,"
of the Cathedral; the "Madonna and Saints," now in
the Gallery, both dated; and a much-injured fresco
in <i>grisaille</i>, representing S. Jerome, on the walls of
the same building&mdash;the Palazzo Communale.</p>

<p>The "Madonna enthroned with Saints" was painted
for the altar of Maffei Chapel in San Francesco, and
was unfortunately removed not many years ago to
the Gallery of the Palazzo Communale, suffering the
greatest damage in the transit. Two large cracks
run through the figures of the Child and the seated
Father; large pieces of the paint have dropped away,
and in the repainting the Child has lost all characteristics
of Signorelli's work. In the less ruined parts,
however, enough remains to testify to the original
excellence of the painting, which is finely composed,
and broadly and vigorously treated, especially in the
draperies.</p>

<p>The Virgin sits enthroned between four saints, with
a very Peruginesque angel on either side, and seated
below, at the foot of her throne, are two Fathers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Church, in one of whom we have repeated the burly
bishop with wide-spread knees and fine sweeping
drapery of the Loreto cupola, and which occurs later
in the Florence Academy altar-piece. The influence
of Pollaiuolo can be observed in the sculptures on
the <i>gradino</i> of the throne, little nude figures in violent
action.</p>

<p>In better preservation is the "Annunciation," in
the Cathedral, signed, and with the same date as the
foregoing. The architecture, with its excellent perspective,
again reminds us that Signorelli was the
pupil of Pier dei Franceschi, the painter of the
wonderful <i>loggia</i> in the "Annunciation," of Perugia.
The Virgin is painted with great feeling, and in the
solemn beauty of the Archangel we get the first of
those splendid creatures whose sublimity Signorelli
felt in the same spirit as Dante, who bent his knees
and folded his hands at the sight of the "<i>Uccel divino</i>,"
"<i>trattando l'aere con l'eterne penne</i>."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The resemblance is so great between this painting
and the "Annunciation," of the Uffizi <i>predella</i> (No.
1298) that we are justified in placing the latter somewhere
about the same date. As is so often the case
in <i>predella</i> pictures, especially with Signorelli's, the
spontaneity and freedom of execution, and even of
conception, is much greater here than in the more
carefully thought-out and finished works. Small as
this panel is, the rush of the great Archangel, the
solemn beauty of the landscape, and the splendid
attitudes of the young courtiers in the last division,
make it one of the master's most important and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
characteristic paintings. The colour in the first panel
of the "Annunciation" is especially beautiful, and
there is a noble simplicity in the composition, as well
as a breadth and certainty of touch that give the
picture great grandeur. The <i>predella</i> is divided by
painted pilasters into three parts. In the first the
Archangel hastens through a rocky pass to announce
the message, to which the Virgin bows with awed
acceptance of its solemn meaning. In the second,
the shepherds kneel to offer homage to the new-born
Child, who lies at the Virgin's feet, while the third
represents the visit of the Magi.</p>

<p>The same freedom of brushwork characterises another
"Annunciation," of probably the same time, and treated
in much the same manner, although less stately than
that of the Uffizi. This is one part of a <i>predella</i>
formerly belonging to the Mancini Collection of Citt&agrave;
di Castello.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Archangel, with great wings half
folded, and blown drapery, is just alighting at the
feet of the Virgin, who has dropped her book, and
drawn back with startled gesture at the impetuous
rush of the messenger.</p>

<p>Connected with these by the same qualities of
breadth of treatment, and almost modern impressionism
in the conception of the scene, are two compartments
of a <i>predella</i>, belonging to Mr Benson in London,
representing "The Dispute by the Way," and "The
Supper at Emmaus." In the former especially, the
dramatic realism with which the Apostles are depicted,
as they argue with animated gestures, is extraordinarily
vivid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet another <i>predella</i> picture&mdash;"The Feast in the
House of Simon," now in the Dublin Gallery&mdash;belongs
approximately to this period. It is a most beautiful
representation of the scene, and is treated somewhat
in the gay manner of Bonifazio or Paolo Veronese.
At a long table, crowded with guests, Christ sits, with
His Mother on His right hand, the master of the
feast being conspicuous in the middle. Over Christ's
head, the Magdalen, a charming and graceful figure,
pours the ointment, and on the left of the table Judas,
with expressive gesture, calls attention to the waste.
Notwithstanding the small size of the panel, and the
number of the figures, the effect is exceedingly spacious
and free. It is a well-composed scene, full of animation,
and broad in treatment, and is fortunately in a good
state of preservation. The altar-pieces to which all
this series of <i>predelle</i> belong are unknown.</p>

<p>We will now consider the fine Standard, painted
in 1494 for the church of Santo Spirito in Urbino.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
On one side was represented the "Crucifixion," and
on the other "The Descent of the Holy Ghost at
Pentecost," but the canvases have now been divided.
In the former, at the foot of the Cross is grouped the
first of those characteristic scenes of the fainting Virgin
which was, probably from its dramatic element, so
favourite a subject with Signorelli. Sincerely and
naturally felt, it in no way trenches on the melodramatic,
as one or two of the later groups tend to
do, and the solitary figure of Christ, raised high above
the sorrowing women, is for once, among his Cruci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>fixions,
of dignity and real pathos. The solemnity of
the mood given, is enhanced by the fine idea of the
soldier on the left, who, impressively standing out
against the sky, shades his eyes, with bewildered
gesture, as though blinded by a sudden comprehension
of the sacrifice. The grief of the women who tend
the unconscious Virgin, is sympathetically realised,
and without exaggeration of outward sorrow. The
composition is specially beautiful, the sides are well-balanced,
while the two mounted soldiers on either
side (notwithstanding their characteristically badly-drawn
horses) give the scene a ceremonious stateliness,
which is very impressive.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Uffizi, Florence</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE ANNUNCIATION</p>
</div>

<p>In the "Pentecost" we have another most masterly
bit of perspective and fine spacious effect. At the
end of a long room, between two rows of the Apostles,
is seated the Virgin. Above is God the Father,
attended by two angels, and below, the tongues of
flame, the gift of the hovering Dove, have alighted on
the heads of all the company. Apart from the sense
of space and the well-composed grouping, the technical
execution does not appear so satisfactory as in the
"Crucifixion," but this may be accounted for by the
fact that the painting has suffered more from restoration.</p>

<p>Very closely allied to this Standard in composition
is the fine "S. Sebastian" of Citt&agrave; di Castello, painted
in 1496 for the church of S. Domenico, now in the
Gallery, which, in spite of its bad condition is a picture
of great importance and beauty. The least satisfactory
part is the Saint himself, who stands bound high up
upon the tree, his sentimental face with upturned eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and open mouth recalling the S. John of several of
the Crucifixions. Above him leans God the Father,
and below five soldiers string their bows or shoot,
with superb gestures. Three of them are in the tight-fitting
clothes in which Signorelli loved to display
the fine proportions and splendidly-developed muscles
of his figures, and the other two are draped only with
the Pollaiuolesque striped loin-cloth. In the middle
distance, burgesses and sad-faced women look on at
the martyrdom, and in the background a distant
street, filled with soldiers, leads steeply up to a ruined
classic building, not unlike the Colosseum. The great
damage which the picture has suffered makes it difficult
on a superficial view to give it the place it really
deserves among the master's works. The colouring
is somewhat crude, especially the flesh-tints, which
are red and heavy, but it must nevertheless be ranked
high on account of the composition, and the fine
drawing and modelling of the foreground figures.</p>

<p class="caption center">THE CRUCIFIXION</p>
</div>

<p>To the following year, 1487, belong the series of eight
frescoes painted by Signorelli in the cloister of the
Benedictine Monastery of Monte Oliveto. Vasari
writes: "At Chiusuri, near Siena, the principal habitation
of the monks of Monte Oliveto, he painted on one
side of the cloister eleven scenes of the life and work of
S. Benedict."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Vasari has mistaken the number of the
paintings, for there were never more than nine, even
supposing the last, of which only a slight fragment
remains, to have been by him. To me it seems doubtful,
but the fragments are in so ruined a state, the
fresco having been almost entirely cut away in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
enlarging of the doorway, that certainty one way or the
other is hardly possible. The remaining eight are for
the most part in a deplorable condition, both from the
damage of time and neglect, and also from repainting,
the lower part of the foreground in all of them being
completely lost, and smeared over with a surface of
thick green. The paintings are very unequal, some
being comparatively poor, while the two last are exceedingly
fine. The story begins in the middle of the
Saint's life. The first scene shows "How God punished
Florenzo," a wicked rival abbot, who had tried to poison
S. Benedict, and to lead his monks astray. In the background
four grotesque devils are tearing down the walls
of his convent, with extraordinary energy of action, and
three others bear away the soul of the monk, whose body
may be seen crushed beneath the ruins. In the foreground
the Saint listens to the tale, told by a kneeling
brother.</p>

<p>The scene is conceived in a spirit somewhat trivial
for Signorelli, and has but little of his usual stately
strength. The composition is too much crowded on
one side, and, as far as can be judged from the state of
the fresco, the draperies of the monks are mechanically
treated. The parts most worthy of praise seem to be
the vivacity of the devils, and the effect of spacious
distance, but it is in so damaged a condition that it
would be unfair to be over-critical.</p>

<p>The next is in an even worse condition. It illustrates
"How S. Benedict converted the inhabitants of Monte
Cassino," to whom, supported by two monks, he preaches
in the foreground. In the middle distance others pull
down from its pillar the statue of Apollo, worshipped by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
these people. This is a very much finer painting. The
composition is again overcrowded on one side, but there
is much noble dignity in the figures of the three monks,
and the beautiful architecture and perspective of the
Temple, are admirable. The foreground has been
entirely destroyed, the draperies are nearly effaced, and
a little town in the background is so smeared over with
green paint, that the effects of distance are lost.</p>

<p>No. III. is in better condition, though very much
injured in the foreground. It shows "How S. Benedict
exorcised the Devil upon the stone," who guarded the
place where the statue of Apollo was buried, which
brought a curse on the convent. In the background is
seen the disinterment of the statue, and to the right, the
vengeance of the Devil, who sets fire to their building.
Flames burst through the windows, and the monks hasten
with excited gestures to quench them. These remind
one in their <i>naivet&eacute;</i> of Carpaccio's scurrying friars, in
S. Giorgio degli Schiavone, Venice. There are some
very fine bits in this fresco; the attitude of the monk
to the left who is heaving up the stone is exceedingly
good and true to nature, and the landscape is spacious
and distant.</p>

<p>No. IV. shows "How S. Benedict resuscitated the
monk upon whom the wall fell," the scene of the death
taking place in the background, the Devil having precipitated
him from the scaffolding on which he was at
work. In the middle distance three brothers bear the
dead body, and in the foreground the Saint stands and
raises him again to life. This fresco is very fine both in
general composition and detail. The little scene of the
death is full of action and animation, the group of monks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
who bear the corpse is dignified, and very noble is the
kneeling figure of the resuscitated friar.</p>

<p>The paintings get gradually better, as though Signorelli
had warmed to his task. The next is very charming
and one of the most successful in composition. It
illustrates "How S. Benedict reveals to two monks
where and when they had eaten out of the Convent."
The two disobedient brothers sit in the foreground of
a long room (of most excellent perspective), and are
served with meats and drinks. At the end of the room,
at the open doorway stands the graceful figure of a
youth. The section of the wall is given, showing in the
distance the penitent brothers on their knees before the
Saint, who has reproved their disobedience. There is
something almost German in the domestic simplicity
with which Signorelli has conceived the scene. The
woman who waits on the right is Peruginesque in type
and attitude, although with the robust physique that
belongs to Signorelli. The fresco is much repainted
especially in the roof.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Monti Oliveto, Maggiore</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MIRACLE OF S. BENEDICT</p>
</div>

<p>The next shows "How S. Benedict reproves the
brother of the monk Valerian for his violated fast," and
reveals to him that it was the Devil who had tempted
him in the disguise of a traveller, the different scenes, as
usual, going on in the background. In front the youth
kneels before the monks, and to the right the Devil, his
horns showing through his cap, tempts him. In the
distance they can be seen feasting under a rock. The
fresco is much injured and repainted, but the figure
of the Devil with the bundle over his shoulder is very
fine and well drawn.</p>

<p>The two last of the series are the best. Signorelli has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in them given the rein to his love of martial scenes, and
painted them with great animation and verve. In No.
VII. we have the scene "How S. Benedict discovers the
deceit of Totila," and unmasks the shield-bearer, who,
disguised as the King of the Goths, comes to prove the
knowledge of the saint. In the background, a plain
covered with camps and soldiers, Totila sends forth his
servant, and in the foreground the Saint, surrounded
by four monks, proclaims to him his identity. Statesmen,
arrogant pages, and warriors, stand behind the
exposed shield-bearer. It is interesting to observe how
Signorelli's attention has wandered from the empty faces
and mechanically executed draperies of the monks, and
concentrated itself on this group. The figures, in their
tight clothes, are superbly posed and modelled, especially
the three who stand next to the shield-bearer.</p>

<p>The last of the frescoes is almost as fine a study
of magnificent attitude. It shows "How S. Benedict
recognises and welcomes Totila," the real King of the
Goths, who kneels before him, surrounded by his
army on horse and foot. In the background, troops
are marching with great animation, (one of those fine
effects of combined movement so characteristic of the
master). Some of the foreground figures are again
splendidly drawn and modelled, and the mounted
soldiers sit their horses exceedingly well.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Monti Oliveto, Maggiore</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MIRACLE OF S. BENEDICT</p>
</div>

<p>In these two last paintings we get a hint of the
great work that was to come three years later&mdash;at
Orvieto. Signorelli has put forth all his strength in
these groups of swaggering youths in every posture
of conscious power and pride, and never perhaps
been more successful in individual figures. Some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the faces in the last fresco appear to be portraits,
and if it be true, as Vasari says, that he painted the
Vitelli and Baglioni, it is here probably that we
should find them rather than among the audience of
Antichrist.</p>

<p>In running the eye down the whole series of
frescoes, the scheme of colour, as far as can be judged
in their present condition, does not strike one as
pleasant. Crude blues, emerald greens, brownish
purples, heavy earthen browns&mdash;these are the predominating
tints. The flesh tones are uniformly red
and heavy. Neither is the decorative effect of the
compositions specially good, as at Loreto, and more
particularly at Orvieto. Perhaps even, on a superficial
view, the space-filling by Sodoma is happier,
and has a more imposing effect. It is chiefly in
detail that the great qualities of Signorelli show
themselves.</p>

<p>The rest of the walls of the large cloister are
painted with twenty-seven subjects by Sodoma, showing
the youth and hermit-life of the saint, and
continuing, after the series by Signorelli, with his
miracles and his old age. Although the subjects
chosen by Luca illustrate the later years, yet they
were painted first, and it is probable that the place
of each scene was arranged before any of the work
was entered upon.</p>

<p>The year following the execution of these frescoes
Signorelli was in Siena, painting the two wings for
the altar-piece of the Bicchi family, formerly in the
church of S. Agostino, now in the Berlin Gallery,
No. 79. A MS. of the Abbate Galgano Bicchi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
which gives the date, speaks of it as an <i>Ancona</i>, the
centre of which was a statue of S. Christopher
by Jacopo della Quercia, and with a <i>predella</i>, which
the Abbate minutely describes.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Nothing now
remains of the altar-piece but these two beautiful
wings, one of which contains figures of the Magdalen,
Santa Chiara, and S. Jerome, the other, of S. Augustine,
S. Antonio and S. Catherine of Siena. Vasari writes
of it: "At Siena he painted in Sant'Agostino, a
picture for the chapel of S. Cristofano, in which are
some Saints surrounding a S. Christopher in relief."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Both panels are of very rich and harmonious colour,
especially the one containing the noble figure of the
Magdalen, in her green robe shot with gold and deep
red mantle, and her ropes of honey-coloured hair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Gallery, Berlin</i></p>
<p class="caption center">SAINTS</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps about the same date, perhaps somewhat
earlier, we may place the fine <i>Tondo</i> (No. 79B) hanging
in the same gallery, formerly in the Patrizi
collection, Rome. I have not given it its usual name
of a "Visitation," because that scene, conventionally
treated, took place before the birth of the children
who here play so important a part. Signorelli has,
according to his habit, conceived the subject without
any reference to traditional custom. I have already
spoken of the ease with which he composes in the
<i>Tondo</i> form, and this is perhaps the best example of
his skill. The natural grouping of the figures, the
sweeping curves of the draperies, which, especially that
of S. Joseph accentuated with gold, carry out the lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the circle, give a sense of rest and harmony to the
eye. The scene is treated with a simplicity and noble
dignity which deserve special praise. It is in some
ways the most sympathetic of all his Holy Families,
and he seems to have felt the charm of every-day
simple life, and for once has given the Christ the life
and beauty of childhood. The tender foreboding sadness
in the face of the Virgin, the reverential sympathy
of the aged Elizabeth, and the kindly care with which
the powerful Zacharias holds the Child, are touches
full of poetry.</p>

<p>Morelli places this <i>Tondo</i> as a late work,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but the
soft and harmonious colour, as well as the poetic
feeling, seem to belong to this period, before the
painting of the Orvieto frescoes, if not even earlier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">

<p class="caption center">HOLY FAMILY</p>
<p class="caption center">(CALLED VISITATION)</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, in this group must be placed the Standard
of Borgo San Sepolcro, painted for the Confraternity
S. Antonio Abbate, now in the Municipio. It is
interesting to note, as its position in the Gallery
allows us to do, how completely Signorelli has now
detached himself from the influence of his first master&mdash;outwardly
at least. No greater contrast could well
be, than the unrestful dramatic realism of the "Crucifixion"
on this Standard, and the inspired serenity of
the "Resurrection" of Pier dei Franceschi close by;
than the coarsely-conceived figure of the crucified
Christ, with its heavy features and uncouth limbs,
and the spiritual beauty of the risen Saviour.</p>

<p>This "Crucifixion" is the least successful of all
Signorelli's renderings of this subject (with the
exception, perhaps, of the Morra fresco), both from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
its technical defects of extreme hardness and heavy
colour, as well as from the lack of any real feeling
in the painter for his subject. The unfortunate introduction
of the patron saint, posing as Joseph of
Arimath&oelig;a, disturbs the harmony of the mood, while
his exaggerated gesture contrasts disagreeably with
the apathetic coldness of the other figures, over-dramatic
as their action is. The Christ is treated
deliberately as a study of muscle, and is among the
most ignominious of his types, and the fantastic landscape,
with its shadowy rocks and solid clouds, is
badly composed and without existence. Although
there is no trace of the influence of Piero remaining,
yet there is much of Antonio Pollaiuolo, especially
in the muscular figure and bent legs of the Christ.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Municipio, Borgo San Sepolcro</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE CRUCIFIXION</p>
</div>

<p>The two large Saints on the reverse of the Standard
are, on the other hand, imposing and noble figures,
splendidly painted in Signorelli's grandest and most
sweeping manner. S. Antonio, in the black habit of
the order for which the banner was executed, stands
reading in a book, and by his side is S. Eligio, the
smith-saint, in red mantle and dark-green robe, holding
in one hand the farrier's tool, and in the other
the cut-off horse's hoof of the legend. Below kneel
small figures of four brothers of the Confraternity.</p>

<p>We have now come to the end of the series of
works, executed, as nearly as can be judged, between
1490 and 1499, and with the latter date have arrived
at the time of the painting of the Orvieto frescoes,
which were to be the crowning point in the life's
work of the master.</p>

<h3>ORVIETO</h3>


<p>There seems to be a moment in the life of every
great man in which he touches the height of
his possibilities, and reaches the limits of his powers
of expression. To Signorelli it came late, at an age
when most men begin to feel at least their physical
powers on the wane. The two last frescoes of the
Monte Oliveto series indicate that an immense force
lay in reserve, waiting an opportunity for some wider
and freer field of action, than had hitherto presented
itself. That opportunity now came, when, at the age
of fifty-nine, he was called upon to undertake the vast
work of these Orvieto frescoes. With the exception
of the Sistine Chapel, no such task has been achieved
at so sustained a pitch of imaginative power and
technical excellence. Whether the subject stirred his
dramatic spirit, or whether the great spaces to be
filled gave an expanded sense of liberty to his genius,
or whether his powers, intellectual and physical, really
were at the zenith of their strength; whatever was the
cause, he succeeded in executing a work which ranks
among the greatest monuments of the Renaissance,
perhaps should even rank as the very greatest.</p>

<p>Morelli writes: "These masterpieces appear to me
unequalled in the art of the fifteenth century; for to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
no other contemporary painter was it given to endow
the human frame with a like degree of passion,
vehemence, and strength."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And beside the dignity
with which he has in these frescoes elevated the body
to an almost superhuman grandeur, his conception of
supernatural things is proportionately solemn and
impressive. It is impossible to look at the scenes
without emotion, and the mood evoked is due in a
great measure to the earnest conviction with which
they are conceived. Signorelli, always a religious
painter, in the wider meaning of the word, seems here
to assume an almost prophetic attitude of warning,
embodied, one might almost think, in the portrait of
himself, stern and menacing, standing sentinel-like
over the work.</p>

<p>Vasari thus speaks of the frescoes: "In the principal
church of Orvieto&mdash;that of the Madonna&mdash;he completed
with his own hand the chapel which had been begun
there by Fra Giovane da Fiesole; in which he painted
all the history of the end of the world, with strange
fantastic invention: Angels, demons, ruins, earthquakes,
fires, miracles of Antichrist, and many other of the
like things; besides which, nudes, foreshortened figures,
and many beautiful designs; having pictured to himself
the terror which will be in that latest tremendous
day. By means of this he roused the spirit of all those
who came after him in such a way that since, they have
found the difficulty of that manner easy. Wherefore
it does not surprise me that the works of Luca should
have always been most highly praised by Michelagnolo,
nor that certain things of his divine Judgement which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
he painted in the chapel were in part courteously taken
from the invention of Luca; as are the Angels, Demons,
the heavenly orders, and other things in which Michelagnolo
imitated the style of Luca, as everyone may
see. Luca portrayed in the above-mentioned work
himself and many of his friends; Niccol&ograve;, Paulo and
Vitellozzo Vitelli; Giovan, Paulo and Orazio Baglioni,
and others whose names are unknown."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Fifty-two years before, in 1447, Fra Angelico had
spent three months and a half in this Cathedral of
Orvieto, painting the spandrels in the roof of the
Cappella Nuova, as it was then called.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He had time
to complete only two frescoes, being either recalled to
Rome by Nicholas V., or to the convent of S. Domenico,
near Fiesole (of which, in 1450, he was made Prior).
These two works are among the best and strongest
of his paintings. In the principal space, that over
the altar, he painted Christ in glory, surrounded by a
<i>mandorla</i>, with angels on either side; and in the
spandrel on the right, a group of sixteen prophets,
seated pyramidally against a blaze of gold background.
It is probable that he had thought out the general
scheme of the frescoes, and that Signorelli only carried
out his intention in working the paintings into one
great whole&mdash;Christ in Heaven, surrounded by Angels,
Apostles, Martyrs, Virgins, Patriarchs and Fathers of
the Church, witnessing from on high the execution of
divine justice below. However that may be, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
certain that Signorelli, in his painting of the roof, kept
most scrupulously to the older master's arrangement,
and in one of the spandrels actually seems to have
worked over his design.</p>

<p>After the withdrawal of Fra Angelico, the chapel
remained untouched for more than fifty years. In
1449 his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, who had probably
been his assistant in the painting, demanded permission
to continue the work; but the authorities were not
content to grant it, and it was only in 1499, after some
futile negotiations with Perugino, who appears to have
refused the commission, that they finally resolved to
place the decoration in the hands of Signorelli. Perhaps
decided to this step by the success of the Monte
Oliveto frescoes, they were yet so cautious and so
determined to have only the very best work in their
chapel, that at first they only entrusted to him the
painting of the vaulting, already begun. They were
wise to be careful in their choice, for they were probably
conscious of the extreme beauty of their cathedral,
and, in particular, of the exquisite architecture of this
chapel. Orvieto Cathedral is one of the finest and
most impressive of the Italian churches, and from
its foundation in 1290, the authorities had been
notoriously lavish in their expenditure for its building,
and fastidious in their choice of architects, sculptors,
and painters.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> From the point of view merely of
decoration, they could have given the work to no
better artist than Signorelli, and the first impression,
on passing into the chapel from the austere and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
spacious nave, is of the harmonious plan, both of
colour and design, with which the original beauty of
the architecture has been enhanced, and its graceful
characteristics accentuated.</p>

<p>The roof is of very perfect shape, and the spaces
well adapted for painting. It is divided in the middle
by an arch, thus having two complete vaultings, each
with four spandrels. The walls are high and spacious,
also divided in two parts, in each of which, on either
side, is a large fresco. Signorelli has separated the
lower part of the wall by a painted frieze of delicate
gold and ivory, and in the lower half executed a series
of portraits, each surrounded by medallions in <i>grisaille</i>,
containing small subject-pictures, the rest of the space
being filled with an intricate pattern of grotesques.
The south wall, in which are three small windows,
has been unfortunately disfigured by a <i>baroque</i> seventeenth-century
altar, whose projections hide a part
of the frescoes. Opposite is the entrance, a magnificently-proportioned
portal, with a rounded arch, most
delicately decorated in colour. Every inch of the
walls is covered, and for the most part by the work
of Signorelli himself, the above-mentioned grotesques,
the merely ornamental painting, and a few of the
medallions alone being by his assistants.</p>

<p>In describing the frescoes I intend to begin with
those of the vaulting, and then to work gradually
round the walls from the left of the entrance, where
the first of the series of larger paintings begins with
"The Preaching and Fall of Antichrist."</p>

<p>In the spandrel opposite the Christ of Fra Angelico,
Signorelli has painted eight angels holding the symbols<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the Passion, while two others, not unlike the great
Archangels of the "Resurrection," blow trumpets to
announce the impending Judgment.</p>

<p>Left of the altar, opposite Fra Angelico's "Prophets,"
and arranged in exactly the same pyramidal form, is
a magnificent group, representing the "Apostles," the
Virgin being seated on the lowest tier with S. Peter
and S. Paul. Very noble, impressive figures, powerfully
and solidly painted, with broadly-draped, heavy-folded
robes, they sit like rocks upon clouds as solid
as hills.</p>

<p>These, with the two frescoes of Fra Angelico, complete
the paintings of the first vaulting.</p>

<p>Those on the other side of the arch are executed
entirely by Signorelli, and, with the exception of one,
from his own designs. This one is the weakest of
his roof-paintings in execution, and the composition
and actual drawing of the central figures, are the work
of Fra Angelico. It represents the "Choir of Martyrs,"
a group of seven figures. In the centre are seated
three Deacons in full canonicals, with Bishops on
either side, and below two Saints in plain robes.
These last have all Signorelli's characteristics of
drawing, and sit with wide-spread knees and broadly-painted
draperies, a striking contrast to the weak
attitudes and niggling robes of the central group.
Signorelli has indeed hardly altered the childish
chubby features of the Deacon in the middle, nor the
benevolent vacuity of the two Bishops, so different to
his own austere types.</p>

<p>Opposite to this, over the portal, is a group of eight
"Virgins," broadly and vigorously treated, in Signorelli's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
boldest manner. To the right is another of the pyramidal
groups, fifteen "Doctors of the Church," some
of whom are represented disputing and discussing
points of theology.</p>

<p>The last of the roof-paintings is a powerful group of
"Patriarchs," ranking, with that of the "Apostles," among
the most impressive of the frescoes. Here appear
many of his well-known types of face; the melancholy
features of Pan are repeated in the turbaned
youth in the top row, intended perhaps to be Solomon;
the Christ of the Uffizi "Holy Family" is in the
second tier to the left; the powerful Zacharias from
the Berlin <i>Tondo</i> in the lowest.</p>

<p>Luzi, in his minute description of the paintings,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> has
bestowed names on all these figures, without much
advantage, since they are for the most part doubtful.
Few of them bear symbols, but the different groups
are sufficiently described in large letters, by the
painters themselves&mdash;<span class="smcap">GLORIOSVS APOSTOLORVM CHOIR&mdash;MARTIRVM
CANDIDATVS EXERCITVS</span>&mdash;etc. etc.</p>

<p>The figures, with the exception of those by Fra
Angelico, and the design for the "Martyrs," are entirely
the work of Signorelli himself. The decorations
between the spaces seem to be in part by the assistant
of Fra Angelico&mdash;perhaps Benozzo Gozzoli. In the
first border heads are painted, in lozenges, at regular
intervals, a few of which are in the older master's style,
while many show the manner of Signorelli. The
rounded projecting rib is painted with foliage of
cypress-green, with here and there rich red and golden
flowers gleaming out, and on either side a border of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
conventionalised water-lilies. It is difficult to say
which of the masters designed this exceedingly beautiful
decoration, but it is most effective, and well-calculated
to accentuate the life of the fine curves in
the vaulting.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">PATRIARCHS</p>
</div>

<p>These groups of Signorelli's are noble and impressive
paintings, in technique strong and vigorous. The
draperies are treated with simplicity and breadth of
fold, and the gold background gives richness and
beauty to the colour. No wonder that the authorities,
jealous though they were at the beauty of their chapel,
should have hesitated no longer to hand over the great
spaces of the walls to the brush of the painter who
had so well executed their first commission.</p>

<p>In the April of the following year, 1500, the new
task was given. The payment for the roof was to
have been 205 ducats; for the walls they offered 575.
Besides this, the painter was to be furnished with
ultramarine, a certain quantity of food and wine, and
a free lodging, with two beds, as the lengthy documents
of commission minutely tell.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The paintings begin with "The Preaching and Fall
of Antichrist." Here the foreground is filled with
groups of the followers of the false prophet, who, with
the features of Christ, stands on a little raised dais,
listening with an evil expression, as the Devil behind
him, unseen by the crowd, whispers into his ear what
he shall say. Before the dais are scattered gold vessels,
bars and coins, with which he tempts the audience.
Farther back to the right, different groups represent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the false teaching and miracles of Antichrist, and in
the background is his Temple, with armed men going
in and out of its open portico. The left of the frescoes
is devoted to the fall of the false prophet, and the
destruction of his followers. Above we see him precipitated
head-downwards from heaven by an angel
surrounded by fiery rays, which strike death to the
army beneath.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE PREACHING AND FALL OF ANTICHRIST</p>
</div>

<p>In sombre black, and standing outside the scene,
Signorelli has painted the portrait of himself, with
fingers interlaced and firmly-planted feet, and behind,
the milder, but still gloomy figure of Fra Angelico.</p>

<p>There is something sinister in the saturnine melancholy
on the faces of the crowd, unrelieved by any
lightness, and culminating in the evil expression of
Antichrist himself. The peace of the gold-flecked
landscape only accentuates the horror of the scene
of the downfall in the background. The picture is a
fit prologue to the terrible Judgment to come.</p>

<p>In composition the fresco is very fine, the values
of distance are well kept, and the meaning of the
scene is obvious and significant, and dramatically
rendered. The foreground group is very strongly
painted, natural in attitude and gesture, and the
figure of a man in striped hose is magnificently
modelled. I do not care to touch on so hypothetical
a thing as the supposed portraiture in this group, but
it is interesting to note, in the old man right of Antichrist,
the features familiar to us in the drawings of
Leonardo, possibly painted from a study of the same
model. Behind is a profile head, obviously intended
for Dante. The terrible force of the angel, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
hawk-like swoop, the unresisting heavy fall of the
body through the air, are rendered with extraordinary
power. The foreshortening is admirable, and so is
the fine perspective of the beautiful architecture of
the Temple.</p>

<p>The figures of the soldiers on the steps recall
Perugino in the manner of treatment&mdash;dark against
light, and well detached from the background. The
capitals of the pillars, the buttons on the clothes, and
the rays of the angel are embossed with gilded gesso,
as also are the distant hills. This form of ornamentation,
so much used by Signorelli in these frescoes,
adds greatly to their decorative beauty.</p>

<p>Under this painting is a square-shaped portrait,
half cut away by a recess, in which stands a modern
altar. It is supposed by Luzi to represent Homer,
and is the first of a series which run all round the
walls, much repainted, but all of them the work of
the master himself. They are surrounded by four
medallions, painted in <i>grisaille</i>, also for the most part
by Signorelli, but in this case only two, and a fragment
of the third, remain, the enlarging of the recess
having almost entirely cut that and the fourth away.
In the top medallion are five nude figures, a powerful
female and four males, all wildly hastening as if from
some impending destruction. In that on the left a
a man stands on a dais, surrounded by soldiers who
hold a prisoner bound before him. In the lower fragment,
only one figure remains. These all represent,
according to Luzi, scenes from Homer. The groups
are well composed and full of vigorous energy, the
nudes are splendidly modelled in broad, bold strokes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
so sharply drawn on the wet plaster that the outlines
are deeply incised. Where, as here, these <i>grisaille</i>
pictures are the work of Signorelli himself, they are
worthy of more attention than is usually given to
them, being as fine as any of his best work. To
realise fully their vigour and excellence, one need
only compare these powerful nudes with those
painted in the pilasters close by, the work of assistants.
The medallions in every case are surrounded
by a broadly painted coloured pattern of grotesques,
also by assistants, but probably to a large extent
designed by Signorelli, for they are extremely
characteristic of his preoccupation with the human
form and with movement. Arabesques have but
little attraction for him, and it will be noticed that
in all his ornamental work where it is possible, he
paints figures. These decorations are almost entirely
composed of fantastic creatures, fauns, tiny satyrs,
horses, birds, etc., who blending their shapes and
borrowing each other's limbs, frisk all over the walls,
and by their gambols and contortions form a pattern
of curves and lines, which is a maze of animated life,
retaining at the same time the broad and harmonious
effect of an arabesque.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 648px;">

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE CROWNING OF THE ELECT</p>
</div>

<p>The next large painting represents "The Crowning
of the Elect." A crowd of men and women, many
draped round the loins, some quite naked, gaze upwards
ecstatically, or kneel reverently to receive the
gold crowns which angels are placing on their heads.
Above, seated on clouds, are nine other angels, draped
in many-folded robes, who play musical instruments.
To the right two figures (in one of whom the Echo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of the "Pan" is repeated) seem to walk out of the
scene, thus connecting this fresco with the next, in
which the elect and crowned souls prepare to ascend
to Heaven.</p>

<p>The background is entirely of gold, thickly studded
with bosses of gilded gesso. The figures are finely
modelled and posed. The flesh-painting, as in all
the frescoes, is perhaps somewhat heavy in colour,
but the whole effect is rich and harmonious. The
chief defects in the work are the overcrowding of the
composition, and the bad values of distance, caused in
a great measure by the gold background. Signorelli's
treatment is too realistic, his figures are too solid and
too true to life, to bear the decorative background so
suitable to the flat, half-symbolic painting of the
Sienese school. They need space and air behind
them, and lacking that, one feels a disagreeable sensation
of oppression and overcrowding. Keeping the
eye upon the ground, which is treated naturally, this
feeling goes; the long shadows distinctly marked,
send the figures to their different planes, and the
confused composition becomes clear.</p>

<p>Underneath are the usual decorations, two square
portraits surrounded each by four medallions. We
do not need the help of Luzi to recognise Dante in
the first, injured though it is, and much repainted,
especially about the mouth, which gives the face a
somewhat grotesque expression.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">SUBJECTS FROM DANTE</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>grisaille</i> paintings represent stories from the
"Purgatorio," but although fine in design, are not
executed by Signorelli himself. They have none of
the breadth and grandeur of the first series, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
effect is meagre and niggling, equal importance being
given to the rocks and to the figures.</p>

<p>The other portrait is probably intended for Virgil,
who, with upturned face and melodramatic expression,
seems to seek for inspiration. This expression is
exaggerated, but the painting is vigorous and strong.</p>

<p>Around, the medallions again represent subjects from
the "Purgatorio," and are apparently by the same hand
as the last, with the exception of the lower one, which
seems to have some of Signorelli's own work in the
nude figures.</p>

<p>The south wall is pierced by three lancet windows,
the central one over the altar, dividing the two
principal frescoes of "Heaven" and "Hell." The
former is, as I have said, a continuation of the last
scene, and represents angels preceding the elect souls,
and showing them the way to Heaven. In the sky,
heavily embossed with gold like the last, float angels
with musical instruments, one of whom, with face downward,
blowing a pipe, is not so successfully foreshortened
as is usual with Signorelli.</p>

<p>In the thickness of the small window which cuts into
this fresco, are painted two coloured medallions, one
of an angel vanquishing a devil, the other of S. Michael,
with the balances, weighing souls&mdash;both by the master
himself. Below are two series of small pictures in
<i>grisaille</i>, with scenes from the "Purgatorio." The lowest
is unfortunately hidden by the altar. All of them are
by Signorelli himself, exceedingly good, and worthy of
careful study, one being especially beautiful&mdash;the top
picture of the first series, in which Dante and Virgil
stand before the Angel, with the gold-plumed Eagle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
in the foreground&mdash;a most nobly conceived illustration
to the ninth canto of the "Purgatorio."</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">HELL</p>
</div>

<p>On the opposite side of the altar is the Judgment
of Minos, and the driving of the lost souls to Hell
under the superintendence of the two Archangels, who
stand in the sky with drawn swords, sorrowfully watching
the fulfilment of divine justice. Signorelli here
has followed very closely the text of the "Inferno." In
the foreground "Minos standeth horribly and gnasheth,"
condemning the miserable souls before him each to his
different circle, his tail wound twice about his middle.
Farther back, the Pistoiese, Vanno Fucci, with
blasphemous gesture, yells out his challenge to God;
Charon plies his boat; and in the background despairing
souls follow a mocking demon who runs before them
with a banner.</p>

<p>The two medallions on the sides of the window
contain, one the Archangel Gabriel with the lily of
the Annunciation, the other a very beautiful group of
Raphael and Tobias, both by Signorelli himself.
Below, the decorations correspond to those on the
opposite side, the <i>grisaille</i> pictures, representing, according
to Luzi, scenes from the "Metamorphoses" of Ovid,
all, with the exception, perhaps, of the medallion just
below the window, being also the work of the master,
and very powerfully painted.</p>

<p>Leaving the window wall, we now come to the finest
of all the frescoes, the magnificent scene of the
"Damnation." So vivid is the realisation, so life-like
the movements and gestures, that the writhing mass
appears really alive, and one can almost hear the
horrible clamour of the devils, and the despairing yells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the victims. The general effect is of one simultaneous
convulsed movement, one seething turmoil. In
detail, the horror is most dramatically rendered. The
malignancy of the devils, their brutal fury as they claw
their prey, tear at their throats, and wrench back their
heads; the utter horror and anguish of the victims, the
confusion, the uproar, are given with a convincing
realistic force, which makes the scene ghastly and
terrible. In most representations of Hell, and especially
of Devils, human imagination fails in conveying any
sense of real horror, even the earnest D&uuml;rer and
Botticelli treating them with a grotesqueness which
shows how far they were from any conviction of
their reality. Signorelli is the only painter of the
Renaissance I can recall who has succeeded in giving a
savage sternness, a formidable brutishness to his fiends,
which is very far from grotesque, but is really appalling.
These ferocious creatures are of all colours, slate-blue,
crude purple, heavy green, livid mauve&mdash;sometimes of
all these poisonous-looking colours fading one into the
other. Strong and malevolent, they triumph in their
work of torture, with a gloomy malignancy very
different from the trifling malice of the fiends he
painted at Monte Oliveto. Above stand the three
Archangels, in armour, with half-drawn swords,
menacing those who try to fly upward instead of
toward the flames of Hell. Two, in their hurry to
escape chastisement, let fall their prey; another, with
great bat-wings which cut the air like scythes, swoops
down again into the chaos below.</p>

<p>I suppose a mass of convulsed limbs has never been
rendered in so masterly a manner. The effect is so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
natural that one is inclined to forget the difficulties
Signorelli has so superbly overcome. But if one considers
in detail the different attitudes, the violent action
of the arms and legs, the contorted positions of the
bodies&mdash;every muscle either on the stretch or relaxed
into a flaccid limpness,&mdash;the foreshortened limbs twisted
into every kind of unnatural posture, and the complicated
interweaving of the whole, one realises that it
is indeed his masterpiece, not only for the mood of
terror and awe it induces by its imaginative power, but
for its marvellous rendering of tumultuous movement,
and the ease with which enormous technical difficulties
have been surmounted.</p>

<p>The portraits below are, according to Luzi, of Ovid
and Horace, the four medallions round the former
seeming, in their energy and furious life, to carry out
the tumult of the great fresco above. They represent
scenes from "The Metamorphoses," and deal chiefly
with Hades and the infernal Deities. Above stand
four female figures with fluttering draperies, among
whom we can distinguish Diana with the bow, and
Pallas with the lance and shield. Below, Pluto stands
in a chariot drawn by dragons. This painting is very
much injured, as is much of this lower part of the
wall, especially the grotesques. On the right Pluto
bears away Persephone in his arms in a chariot drawn
by two fantastic horses, which an attendant urges
furiously forward with a caduceus. On the left Ceres,
with wildly-floating hair, leaps into a tearing chariot
drawn by two winged serpents, which Cupid goads
onward with a flaming torch. These are all by
Signorelli himself, and, for the rendering of violent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
movement, worthy of their position under the great
painting.</p>

<p>Round the other portrait are subjects also connected
with the infernal regions. Over it, &AElig;neas
stands before the Cum&oelig;an Sybil, a very injured
painting. Below, Orpheus in Hades plays before
Pluto and Persephone to win back Eurydice, who
lies bound before them. On the right Hercules rescues
Theseus from Hades, and slays Cerberus, and on the
left, Eurydice, following Orpheus, looks back, and is
re-seized by the demons. These are all exceedingly
good and dramatic paintings, and are by Signorelli
himself.</p>

<p>The next large space, after the fresco of "The
Damnation," is filled with "The Resurrection." Above,
the two mighty Archangels sound their trumpets, and
the dead wake, and break through the crust of the
grey earth below. They stand about embracing each
other, or helping each other to rise, or gazing with
rapture up at the Archangels, who, with fluttering
draperies and ribbons, and great spread wings of
purple and peacock-green, stand, surrounded by little
shadowy cherubs, in the gold-embossed sky. Most of
the figures are of Signorelli's usual powerful build, one,
however, is an emaciated youth with little on his
bones but skin, many are skeletons. To these last he
has given a pathetic look of ecstasy, which is wonderfully
expressive, considering it is obtained only by means of
eyeless sockets and grinning jaw-bones.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE RESURRECTION</p>
</div>

<p>The fresco has suffered much, particularly from the
painting, in later times, of draperies round the loins,
some of which have been worn or rubbed half off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Almost in the centre is a large stain, outlining the
shape of a window, which Signorelli caused to be filled
up, and which can still be seen on the outside of the
Cathedral. The damp, oozing through the new plaster
round the framework, partly destroyed the painting,
but the centre is remarkably well preserved.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in studying this fresco,
that, student of anatomy though he was, the skeleton
seems to have had little attraction for Signorelli. The
placing of the bones is, of course, correct, but the
delicacy of their curves, their relative proportions and
thicknesses, their beauty of detail, are not given at
all. For example, in the skeleton in the foreground,
the pelvis has scarcely the shape, and none of the
variety of line, of the bone itself, but is merely a
coarsely-drawn girdle. Compared to the extreme
delicacy with which he models flesh, and his minute
appreciation of every gradation of curve in the muscles,
this carelessness in the treatment of the skeleton is
noteworthy.</p>

<p>Under this, the last of the larger frescoes, is a
recess, in which was formerly the sarcophagus containing
the bones of Pietro Parens, the patron saint
of Orvieto. In this recess, under the brackets on
which the sarcophagus stood, Signorelli has painted one
of his most beautiful "Piet&agrave;s." Unfortunately, half
hidden by a marble group, sculptured in 1574 by
Ippolito Scalza, it is difficult to see, and impossible
to photograph, and is therefore not so well known
and appreciated as it deserves to be. The Christ is
an exact repetition of the figure in the "Deposition,"
of the Cortona Cathedral, and was probably painted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
about the same time&mdash;1502. The position only is
reversed. The other two figures are also repeated
from that altar-piece, with only very slight variations.
Behind is painted the Tomb, on which is a relief in
<i>grisaille</i> of four naked figures bearing the dead body
of the Saviour. This formed the lower part of the
now removed sarcophagus, the three stone supports
of which still project from the wall. On the right of
the "Piet&agrave;," is painted the martyr Pietro Parens himself.
The saint gazes down with tender reverence at the
scene at his feet, standing in fur-trimmed robes and
cap, one hand on his breast, the other holding the
palm of martyrdom. Over his head is the hammer, the
instrument of his death. The face is of extreme beauty,
with gentle expression, the robes are finely draped, the
attitude most natural, and the whole figure is one of the
noblest and most sympathetic of all Signorelli's works,
and deserves to be better known. On the other side,
and also as supporter of the "Piet&agrave;," stands Faustinus,
another patron saint of the city, also a very beautiful
figure, with features which recall the type generally
used by Signorelli for S. John. At his feet lies the
millstone with which he was drowned. On either side,
in the thickness of the wall, is a medallion in <i>grisaille</i>,
containing the scenes of their deaths, very powerfully
painted.</p>

<p>This recess occupies more than one half of the space
below "The Resurrection," allowing room for only
one portrait and two medallions. The former Luzi
has decided to be Lucan, and represents a beautiful
youth, with a mass of loose curling hair crowned with
oak-leaves and acorns. The scenes of the medallions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
are supposed to be from "The Phaisalia." In that
above three nude men fight with fists, one binds his
prostrate foe, and another bears off a slain body. In
that on the right four men fight with clubs and swords.
All are powerful figures, painted by Signorelli in his
most characteristic manner. Below the portrait of the
poet is an inscription of 1667, honouring the memory
of Signorelli, and of Ippolito Scalza, the sculptor of
the marble "Piet&agrave;."</p>

<p>The frescoes round the beautifully-proportioned
entrance portal, being on an inside wall, are in a state
of better preservation than the rest, and the colours
brighter. They represent "The Signs of the Destruction
of the World." For imaginative power they can be
compared only with the woodcuts of Albrecht D&uuml;rer's
"Apocalypse." To our right on entering, the "Rain
of Fire" shoots in heavy lines from the hands and bodies
of demons with outspread wings. The distraction of
the people on whom it falls is well rendered. In the
foreground armed men on horse and foot seek wildly
to escape the shafts, which have already precipitated
some to the ground. In the middle distance the
flames pursue a flying mob of terrified women clutching
their infants, and men trying to protect them; while
in the foreground old men, youths, and children, are
struck down in heaps, stopping their ears, and gazing
up in panic at the unearthly apparition.</p>

<p>On the opposite side the sun and moon are eclipsed,
and a dark rain of blood falls from the gloomy sky.
An earthquake has shaken the city, and its buildings
totter and fall in fragments on the people. In the
foreground is a group, perhaps intended for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Prophets of the Destruction, who gaze up, less terrified,
but with fear and solemn awe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 626px;">
<a id="Figure_32" name="Figure_32"></a>
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="626" height="476" alt="SIGNS OF DESTRUCTION" title="" />
<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Cathedral, Orvieto</i></p>
<p class="caption center">SIGNS OF DESTRUCTION</p>
</div>

<p>Next to "The Damnation," these are perhaps the
finest of the series, and show most imagination and
dramatic feeling. The foreshortening of some of the
figures is admirable, the composition in the restricted
space is good, and there is superb drawing and
modelling in the foreground figure among the Prophets
in the last fresco.</p>

<p>In the centre, over the arch, Signorelli has painted a
group of winged children, who hold a tablet by a bunch
of ribbons, in one of whom are repeated the features of
the Christ-child of the Uffizi "Holy Family."</p>

<p>In the space under "The Rain of Fire" has been
painted a portrait, but not a fragment of the face
remains, an obelisk-shaped monument having in later
times been placed against the wall, completely destroying
it. Cavalcaselle, for what reason is not clear to me,
supposes that it represented Niccol&ograve; Franceschi, the
treasurer of the works. On the opposite side of the
doorway is a coloured medallion, representing a man
with a turban, who, leaning his back over the frame as
though it were a window, seems to be gazing up at the
painting above. This, Cavalcaselle suggests, is a portrait
of the painter himself; Luzi, however, considers it to be
Empedocles. Over it in the decorations are two small
tablets bearing the master's initials, L. and S.</p>

<p>We began by considering the general impression of
the frescoes upon the mind, their great imaginative
qualities, and the solemn mood they induce. We will
conclude by summing up the technical excellences,
which distinguish them from all his previous work by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
extra power and ability. The beauty of the compositions,
the filling of the spaces and the effectiveness of
the scheme of decoration are as much above the work
of three years before&mdash;the Mount Oliveto series&mdash;as is
the freedom and dramatic power with which the scenes
are rendered.</p>

<p>What chiefly strikes one is the homogeneousness of
the whole design, each part of the work keeping its due
place in the great scheme. We are never unconscious,
even while carried away by the emotions of each
separate scene, of the solemn presence of the Judges
above, who preside over the final justice. Considered
as subject-pictures, the intense dramatic feeling makes
them extremely powerful in their different effects, so
that it is impossible to look at them unmoved. Finally,
the facility and freedom with which his anatomical
knowledge has allowed Signorelli to render all the
possibilities of movement and gesture, is as much in
advance of his age, as is his modern and natural
visualisation, and the impressionistic breadth of his
brushwork. In that respect, indeed, it is impossible to
go farther. Later painters have erred as much in exaggerating
violent action and over-developing muscles, as
the earlier master fell short in dry and laborious stiffness.
Signorelli, while retaining the earnest sincerity and
thoughtfulness of the earlier workers, has been able at
the same time to render with modern facility every
movement of the human frame, and the result is an
achievement which no later skill has surpassed, which
is perhaps the last word in the treatment of the nude in
action.</p>

<p>Before closing these remarks, I must not omit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
record the gratitude due to the two German painters,
Bothe and Pfannenschmidt of W&uuml;rtemburg, who, in
1845, at their own cost, cleaned and carefully restored
the frescoes, a work done on the whole with great
discretion.</p>

<p>Two other paintings of the master, now in the Opera
del Duomo, are so closely connected with the chapel,
that the description would be incomplete without mention
of them here&mdash;the altar-piece of the Magdalen, and the
portraits of himself and the treasurer of the Cathedral,
Niccol&ograve; Franceschi.</p>

<p>The former, painted originally for the Cathedral, is a
life-sized, very broadly painted figure, somewhat coarse
in execution, but exceedingly powerful. She wears a
gorgeous gold garment, elaborately embroidered, and
over it a brownish-red mantle lined with green. There
is a stately dignity in the picture itself which the
photograph unfortunately does not reproduce. It is
dated 1504, and on the old frame is the following
Inscription:</p>

<p class="center">CECCARELLEVS . DE . APVIDVTIS&mdash;ET . RVFINVS .</p>
<p class="center">ANTONII . &mdash;</p>
<p class="center">CONSERVAT . PA . PACIS . CONSERVATRICI . EX . SE .</p>
<p class="center">CONSVLTO . M.D.IIII.</p>

<p>The double portrait, painted in 1503,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> is a work of the
greatest importance, both by reason of the interest
attached to the portraiture, and also that it remains to
us absolutely untouched, every stroke being in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
original state as the master left it. The heads are full
of character and life, powerfully and rapidly painted in
black and red, on a brick or tile, thickly overlaid with
gesso. The brush-strokes are bold and firm, and the
outline slightly incised in the plaster. Under each
head Signorelli has painted the names <span class="smcap">LVCA</span> and
<span class="smcap">NICOLAVS</span>, and on the back is a most interesting inscription,
apparently painted by himself, although the words
are most probably the composition of the Treasurer.
The following is a translation: "Luca Signorelli, an
Italian by race, citizen of Cortona, renowned for his
skill as a painter, comparable to Apelles for attainment,
has, under the rule and in the pay of Niccol&ograve; Franceschi,
of the same race, but a citizen of Orvieto, Treasurer of
the vestry of its Cathedral, painted with clear meaning
this chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, with figures of the
Last Judgment; and, eager for immortal fame, on the
back of this inscription, has painted the effigy of both,
life-like, and with wonderful art. In the reign of Pope
Alexander VI. and of the Emperor Maximilian IV. in
the year of grace <span class="smcap">M.CCCCC.</span> in the third Kalends of
January."</p>

<h3>LATER PAINTINGS</h3>


<p>We have seen that during the four years and a half
in which Signorelli was engaged on the great
work of the Orvieto frescoes, he yet spent some part
of the time in his native city, and there, in 1502, he
painted the signed and dated "Deposition" with its
<i>predelle</i> for the church of Santa Margherita, now
removed to the Cathedral. Vasari thus speaks of it:
"In Santa Margherita of Cortona, his native town,
belonging to the Frati del Zoccolo, he painted a dead
Christ; one of his most excellent works."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This dead
Christ is the figure which by its realism and pathos
gave rise to the legend, already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that it was
painted from the body of his own son. It is an
exact counterpart of the "Piet&agrave;" in the Orvieto
frescoes, except that it is here reversed. It is a work
of great beauty and feeling, painted with sincere
emotion, and has none of the academic dryness with
which he treated the same subject in Borgo San
Sepolcro. The fine grouping, the restraint with
which the sorrow is rendered, the real pathos of the
scene, give the picture dignity and solemnity, and
the glow of colour, obtained by the lavish use of gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in the embroideries, add to its richness and decorative
beauty. The Virgin is nearly the same figure as in
the Orvieto fresco, and in feature recalls the San
Sepolcro "Crucifixion," and the Magdalen is almost
identical with the altar-piece of the Opera del Duomo,
just considered, although here painted with more
refinement and grace. In the background is one of
those vivid scenes of crowded movement, which occur
so often at this period of the master's development&mdash;a
group of excited soldiers pressing round the
Cross, with fluttering pennons and prancing steeds.
The <i>predella</i> hung just below, contains four subjects&mdash;"Christ
in Gethsemane," "The Last Supper,"
"The Betrayal," and "The Flagellation." Unfortunately,
both pictures are so badly lighted that it is
almost impossible except on a very bright day to
appreciate the colour. The scenes in this <i>predella</i>
are nearly the same as in that of the Florence
Academy, which hangs as part of the altar-piece,
No. 164, although it does not seem really to have
belonged to it. The two <i>predelle</i> must certainly
have been painted within a very short time of one
another. In both the composition of "The Last
Supper" is precisely the same, as well as "The
Flagellation." In the "Betrayal" there is the same
violent crowd with spears and pennons, surging round
the Christ. In the Florence picture, however, there are
only three divisions, "The Betrayal" and "The Way
to Calvary" forming the background to "The Agony
in the Garden," where Christ kneels before a little
brook, with the Apostles sleeping in rows behind
Him. The broad impressionistic manner in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
they are painted is the same; and, coarse as is the
brushwork, dark and heavy as is the colour, especially
in the flesh tints, they are yet exceedingly fine
examples of Signorelli's bold style and quick resolute
workmanship, and well illustrate his power of rendering
violent combined movement, in the crowds
which throng round the betrayed Christ, and march
tumultuously on the way to Calvary.</p>

<p>The "Madonna and Saints" above this last
<i>predella</i> (No. 164) although according to Signor
Milanesi, not its altar-piece,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> must certainly have been
painted somewhere about the same time, for the
broad style, tending rather to coarseness, of the work
of this period is very noticeable. It was executed for
the church of Santa Trinit&agrave; in Cortona, and Milanesi
suggests that it might be the altar-piece ordered in
1521 by the authorities of that church,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> but the
description given by the document of commission is
very different, and the picture itself seems to bear
evidence of an earlier date. Like so many of the
works in this Gallery, the painting has been so
thickly daubed over by modern restorers, that it is
next to impossible to form a just idea of the original
colour; in its present state it is disagreeably crude
and heavy, and in any case the overcrowding of the
composition would prevent its being considered a
successful example of the master's work, although it
has his usual stately dignity and impressive qualities
in the individual figures. The Virgin sits with the
Child on her knee, clad in red robes, over which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a garment, now smeared over with black paint, but
which formerly was covered with gold embroideries.
Over her head is a Trinity, in a <i>mandorla</i> surrounded
by cherubs. On the left stands the Archangel Michael,
in Roman armour, holding the balances, in which are
little nude figures representing the souls of the dead;
on the right stands Gabriel with the lily and scroll
containing the Message of the Annunciation. Below,
seated at the foot of the throne, are Saint Augustine
and Saint Anastasio, the latter the same burly Bishop
with wide-spread knees of the Loreto Cupola, and
the Volterra altar-piece. These two Saints are fine,
stately figures, painted with broad sweeping lines.
The green robe of S. Anastasio was originally covered
with a gorgeous pattern, probably of yellow or gold,
but this has been effaced by the thick smear of
repaint. The gentle humility in the face of the
Virgin recalls the "Madonna," of the Brera Gallery,
Milan (No. 197 <i>bis</i>) with which the picture has,
besides, much in common, the Child, as well as the
hands of the Virgin, being exactly the same, although
in a reversed position. We shall not probably be
far wrong in placing the Florence altar-piece about
the same time as this "Madonna," of the Brera, which
is dated 1508, and was painted for the church of S.
Francesco in Arcevia (a town famous for its possession
of one of Signorelli's most important works,
which we shall presently consider). Very much
repainted, the Madonna still retains great charm and
beauty, but the composition is geometrical, and the
figures of the Saints uninteresting and empty. In
these, especially the standing figure on the left, I feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the hand of an assistant. With all Signorelli's
mannerisms, it lacks his resolute touch and powerful
presentation. It is probable that the great inequalities
in many of his paintings, especially at this later
time, are due to his leaving much of the execution
to assistants. Whatever faults are in the work of the
master himself, he is never, up to the last, guilty of
any feebleness or insipidity, such, for instance, as in
the painting of this unsolid figure.</p>

<p class="caption center">MADONNA AND SAINTS</p>
</div>

<p>I have been led from one picture to another by
reason of similarities of form, and have omitted to
speak of a beautiful and important painting, evidently
executed soon after the Orvieto frescoes, with which
it has much in common. This is the altar-piece in
the church of S. Niccol&ograve;, Cortona, on one side of
which is a "Madonna and Saints," on the other a
"Dead Christ upheld by Angels." It is as far as I
know, original in idea&mdash;this dead Christ supported by
the Archangel, while others show the symbols of the
Passion to the group of kneeling Saints. The four
Angels are very noble figures, and resemble those of
the "Hell" and "Resurrection," of Orvieto. The "S.
Jerome" is sincerely painted, and without any of the
senile sentimentality with which Signorelli occasionally
represents this Saint. The one false note in the work
is the stunted figure of the dead Christ, which seems
all the more insignificant by contrast with the grand
Archangel who supports it. This poetic figure with
its great wings and its tender beauty is perhaps the
greatest of all the master's renderings of the "Divine
Birds." The colour scheme is much lighter than usual,
the flesh-tints being especially fair, and the painting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
is another instance of those seeming efforts to adopt
a less heavy palette, to which I have drawn attention
in speaking of the Uffizi <i>Tondo</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Vischer considers the "Madonna and Saints" on
the reverse of the panel to have been painted at a
different date.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It is an exceedingly fine picture, with
all the great qualities of majestic beauty. The Virgin
sits enthroned between SS. Peter and Paul, robed in
red, and wearing a blue mantle lined with green.
The Child, half lying on her knee, has his hand raised
in act to bless. It is well modelled, and of a more
pleasing type than usual.</p>

<p>In 1507 was painted another very important work&mdash;the
altar-piece in the church of S. Medardo in
Arcevia, a splendid <i>Ancona</i>, still in its original
Gothic frame. The Virgin is of the same tender type
as in the Brera and Florence Academy pictures, but
with an added stateliness and gravity. In the centre
panel she sits enthroned, with the Child on her knee,
clad in an embroidered robe, on the breast of which
are two naked cherubs. On the left stand S. Medardo
and S. Sebastian, on the right S. Andrew and S. Rock,
each figure separated, as in the old polyptychs, by
the pilasters of the frame. Above is God the Father,
with two Saints on either side, left S. Paul and S. John
the Baptist, right S. Peter and S. James of Camerino.
Each of the side pilasters of the frame is divided into
seven small spaces, each containing the half figure of
a saint, the work of assistants. The effect of the
whole painting is of great splendour, the colours are
of glowing depth, and the richness enhanced by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
low relief in gilded gesso of some of the brocades.
But with all its state and dignity, perhaps the most
important part of the altar-piece is the <i>predella</i>
with its five beautiful pictures, flanked on either side
by the arms of Arcevia. As colour these are remarkably
fine and are treated with more care and less
rapidity than Signorelli usually gave to <i>predella</i> work,
while retaining the same breadth and freedom of
general effect. "The Annunciation," with its beautiful
perspective, is one of his best compositions of this
subject, in which he is always so successful. "The
Nativity" recalls that of the Uffizi <i>predella</i>; "The
Adoration of the Magi" is a fine rendering of the
scene, but the two last are the most interesting as
well as being the best in workmanship. In "The
Flight into Egypt" the painter has evidently been
influenced by the engravings of Albrecht D&uuml;rer, and
has painted the little fortified town of the background
very much in his manner. "The Murder of the
Innocents" contains two figures in splendid action,
the executioners, one with his dagger raised in act
to strike, the other holding the child up by the leg&mdash;both
magnificent studies of the nude, and worthy of
the painter of the Orvieto frescoes.</p>

<p>Very inferior is the altar-piece of "The Baptism,"
in the same church of S. Medardo. The existence of
the contract of commission, dated June 5, 1508,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
shows that Signorelli bound himself to paint the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
figures of Christ, of the Baptist, and of God the Father,
with his own hand, leaving the rest of the work to his
best pupils. These figures are, however, so different
from any of the master's own work, that it is difficult
to believe that they are entirely by him. The picture
had evidently to be finished in great haste, since the
receipt for payment in Luca's hand is dated the 24th
of the same month of June, thus leaving only nineteen
days between commission and completion, a very
short time for so large a work. The Baptist stands
in a rich red mantle pouring the water on the head
of the Herculean Christ, who wears the Pollaiuolesque
striped loin-cloth. The coarseness and exaggeration
of the muscular development have not the characteristics
of Signorelli's own errors in over-realism, but
bear the same relation to his style that the work of
Bandinelli bears to that of Michelangelo. Above is a
feeble figure of God the Father, and in the middle
distance a man pulls off his shirt, reminding one, both
in form and treatment, of the figures in Pier dei
Franceschi's "Baptism," of the National Gallery.
Another sits by the river putting on a sandal, not
unlike, although very inferior to, the athlete of the
Munich <i>Tondo</i>. The composition is grand, and in
the importance given by it to the two principal figures
we certainly see the work of Signorelli. The picture
is an example of one of those mysterious conflicts of
documentary and internal evidence, which the study
of Art occasionally furnishes. It still remains in its
beautiful original frame, in the gables of which is
painted an "Annunciation," and below, on each side,
three half figures of Saints by some assistant, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
not even a pupil of Signorelli, but obviously a follower of
Niccol&ograve; da Foligno. The <i>predella</i> contains five scenes.
"The Birth of the Baptist," "The Preaching in the
Desert," "The Denouncing of Herod and Herodias" (a
<i>Tondo</i>), "The Feast of Herod," and&mdash;rather out of its
due course, since the head is offered in the charger in
the fourth scene&mdash;"The Decapitation in Prison."</p>

<p>There is a very beautiful fragment of an unknown
<i>predella</i> in the possession of Mr Jarvis of New
Haven, U.S.A., which belongs approximately to this
period. It has all the impressive dignity and breadth
of treatment of Signorelli's best work. The subject
is conceived with special feeling for its stateliness,
Joseph standing by the side of the Virgin to receive
the gifts, as a Chamberlain might stand beside the
throne, while the earnest reverence of the kneeling
King, who has cast his crown at the feet of the Child,
is most nobly rendered. The gold in the brocaded
robes is here slightly in relief. The face of the kneeling
King recalls that of the aged Apostle in "The
Institution of the Eucharist," Cortona, a painting
dated 1512; a beautiful picture, executed for the
high altar of the Ges&ugrave;, but which has now been
removed to the Cathedral. Like the other works in
this choir it is very badly lighted, and the photograph
is also indistinct. Vasari writes of it: "In
the Compagnia del Ges&ugrave;, in the same city (Cortona),
he painted three pictures, of which the one over the
high altar is marvellous, where Christ communicates
the Apostles, and Judas puts the wafer in his
satchel."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> At the end of a shallow hall, in the usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
good perspective, His head accentuated against the
sky, as in Leonardo's "Last Supper," Christ stands,
and puts the sacred wafer in the mouth of a kneeling
Apostle. In the foreground Judas, with a crafty
look, opens his satchel. The composition is exceedingly
fine, the twelve Apostles making a stately frame
for the central figure of Christ. The attitudes and
gestures are natural and dramatic, and the faces have
individual character.</p>

<p>The two other pictures of which Vasari speaks as
having also been painted for the Ges&ugrave;, now the Baptistery,
are&mdash;"The Nativity" (a coarse and badly-painted
school picture, having affinities with that of the National
Gallery, London, No. 1133), and a "Madonna and Saints,"
which still remains in the Baptistery. Here the Virgin
sits, with a Bishop on either side, and two monks below.
Dry and precise in composition, like that of the Brera,
and apparently painted with the assistance of pupils, the
Madonna herself is still very characteristic of the master,
and not unlike those of the Brera and the Florence
Academy. The picture is in an exceedingly ruined
state, and the gabled top in which is painted God the
Father, though not without merit, does not belong to
the original painting, but is of a later date.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may place in this group, the broadly-painted
<i>predella</i>, which hangs now, badly lighted, in the
sacristy of the Arezzo Cathedral. It is unknown to
what altar-piece it belonged, and the pictures are now
divided and separately framed. The first represents
"The Birth of the Virgin," the second "The Presentation,"
and the last "The Marriage." "The Presentation"
is the finest in composition and general effect, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
contains very stately figures of Joachim and Anna,
with splendidly draped robes, and behind them a fine
austere landscape. All three pictures are broadly
painted and swept in in the usual impressionistic
manner.</p>

<h3>LAST WORKS</h3>


<p>We have now considered in detail most of the
important works of Signorelli's early manhood
and maturity, and up to his seventy-fourth year have
found him, both in conception and execution, still
maintaining a high standard of excellence, and at an
age when the life's work is supposed to be over showing
but little sign of failing powers. On the contrary, he
seems to have gained ground in certain things most
characteristic of his technical ability&mdash;in a rugged
strength of modelling, in facility of drawing and
freedom of brushwork, and particularly in that mastery
of united movement, which it seemed his special
desire to attain. Even in this last group of paintings
which we have now to consider the mind works as
powerfully, and the subjects are conceived with the
same impressive grandeur, as before, and only in one
or two instances can it be noticed that the hand does
not always respond so readily to the purpose.</p>

<p>In the "Madonna and Saints," of the Mancini
collection, Citt&agrave; di Castello, a slight technical falling
off is apparent, although it is possible that this may
be due to the assistance of pupils. Its history would
seem, however, to point to its being the unaided work
of Signorelli; but, as we have already seen, documentary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
evidence is by no means infallible. In the archives of
Montone, a little town near Umbertide, a deed, dated
September 10, 1515, was discovered, which speaks of an
altar-piece presented by the master as a free gift to a
certain French physician, Luigi de Rutanis, in gratitude
"for services rendered, and for those which he hoped
to receive in future."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Mancini Coll., Citt&agrave; di Castello</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MADONNA AND SAINTS</p>
</div>

<p>The Virgin stands heavily on the heads of cherubs,
with S. Sebastian on one side, and Santa Cristina,
with a terribly realistic millstone hung round her neck,
on the other. Two angels hold the crown over her
head, and below stand S. Jerome and S. Nicholas of
Bari, both intently reading. The background stretches
away into a charming distant landscape, in which is a
lake, not unlike Trasimeno, and sloping hills, on which
scenes of pastoral life are taking place. This landscape,
taken by itself, is the best part of the painting;
of the rest, the composition is too mechanically precise,
the values of distance are bad, the figures being all on
the same plane, and even the landscape does not keep
its proper place in the picture. This last fault may,
however, be due to repainting, which is so thick that
it is useless to speak of the present colour. The
altar-piece was discovered by Signor Giacomo Mancini
in a cellar in Montone, almost destroyed by damp and
neglect, and since its restoration it is perhaps hardly
fair to discuss more than the general lines; yet these,
in the awkwardness of arrangement, and the comparative
triviality of the figures, both in attitude and
gesture, betray a weakness we have not hitherto met
with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Another picture of the same date&mdash;1515&mdash;is "The
Madonna and Saints," in the church of San Domenico,
Cortona, also in very bad condition. The restoration of
the seventeenth century added a piece of canvas all
round, in order to enlarge it. It was painted for
Serninio, Bishop of Cortona, whose portrait is to be seen
in the corner, full of expression and exceedingly well
modelled. The Virgin, in red robe and green mantle,
sits with her feet resting on the heads of cherubs, with
an angel on either side, and below S. Peter Martyr,
and S. Domenico. It is an important work, and
among the most successful of the later paintings,
and it is curious that it should not have been photographed
by either of the larger firms.</p>

<p>The next year, 1516, Signorelli painted "The Deposition,"
of Umbertide, in which he shows all the technical
power of his maturity&mdash;(or was it, perhaps, that he left
less of the execution to assistants?). It was executed for
the little dark church of Santa Croce, in this village,
till recently called La Fratta, and still stands over the
high altar&mdash;not, however, in its original frame, which
was removed in the seventeenth century. It seems
that there was a lunette over the top, containing a
Piet&agrave;.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Terribly defaced by bad restoration, and the
cracking of the later paint, it is still a very beautiful
work, and its <i>predella</i> has all the qualities of boldness
and freedom characteristic of the master's best times.
Some of the figures are perhaps too obviously life-studies,
especially the Mary, standing in the foreground
left, which he evidently painted straight from
some <i>contadina</i>, whose stolid features he reproduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
without reference to the subject. The body of the
Christ is successful, and has all the weight and helpless
inertia of a corpse; the composition is admirable,
and there is sincerity of emotion in the painting of
much of the scene. It is, however, in the three
pictures of the <i>predella</i> that we shall find most
proof of the vigour of mind and hand. It is interesting
to compare Signorelli's treatment of the
same subject with that of Pier dei Franceschi in
Arezzo, at the painting of which he probably assisted,
more than forty years before&mdash;"The March of Constantine,"
"The Discovery of the Cross," and "The
Entry of Heraclius into Jerusalem." The first of
the three is the best, both for the special quality of
animated movement, and for the excellence of its
composition and its effect of spacious movement.
How much larger a tiny panel like this appears
than some of the crowded altar-pieces of his later years!
Dashed in with a few broad touches, as a modern
impressionist might paint, the scene of the camp is
most natural, with its groups of soldiers and marching
troops with raised lances and fluttering pennons.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Santa Croce, Umbertide</i></p>
<p class="caption center">THE DEPOSITION</p>
</div>

<p>In the second, three scenes are run into one, without
much reference to any sequence of the story. On
the right the Queen of Sheba kneels before the bridge
which she has recognised as the sacred wood; on the
left the Empress Helena finds the three crosses; and
in the centre takes place the testing of the true one
in the resuscitation of the dead youth. In the third&mdash;"The
Entry of Heraclius into Jerusalem"&mdash;we have
again a splendid effect of a moving body of men. The
Emperor has descended from his horse, which is led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
behind him, and barefooted, in his shirt, he carries the
Cross within the gates.</p>

<p>The next dated work&mdash;"The Madonna and Saints,"
of the Arezzo Gallery, was painted three years after
this, in 1519. "He executed," says Vasari, "in his
old age, a picture for the Compagnia of S. Girolamo,
part of which was paid for by Messer Niccol&ograve;
Gamurrini, Doctor of Law, Master of the Rolls,
whom he portrayed from life in that picture, on
his knees before the Madonna, to whom he is presented
by a S. Nicholas, also in the said picture;
there are besides, S. Donato and S. Stephen, and below
a nude S. Jerome, and a David who sings on a Psaltery;
there are also two Prophets, who appear, by the scrolls
in their hands, to be discussing the Conception."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<a id="Figure_38" name="Figure_38"></a>
<img src="images/i147.jpg" width="454" height="677" alt="MADONNA, SAINTS, AND PROPHETS" title="" />
<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Gallery, Arezzo</i></p>
<p class="caption center">MADONNA, SAINTS, AND PROPHETS</p>
</div>

<p>The commission was given to Luca by the Compagnia
of S. Girolamo, on September 19, 1519, and the
price was to be one hundred broad gold florins, to be
shared by Messer Gamurrini and the Confraternity.</p>

<p>In this picture it is in the intention rather than the
execution that we shall find the vigour and strength
which ended only with the painter's life. Much still
remains grand and impressive, but though it shows
considerable power, the actual work is not so good.
The colour is exceedingly dark, and full of harsh
contrasts; the composition is overcrowded, as in
many of his later paintings; and the figure of David,
although nobly conceived, is awkward and ill-balanced.
On the other hand, the Virgin is as powerfully executed
as ever, and so is the earnest, white-haired Prophet at
her feet. It seems to me that the master has given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
his own features in this upturned face, with its firmly-cut
lips and square jaw, certainly much more real a
person than the apathetic kneeling Donor. After its
removal from its original place over the altar of the
Confraternity, the picture was for several years in
Santa Croce, and, after the suppression of that convent
in 1849, removed to Santo Spirito, and from
thence to the Gallery.</p>

<p>Very close to it in style, and probably painted at
no distant date, is the <i>predella</i> owned by Mr
Ludwig Mond. It has three stories&mdash;I. Ahasuerus
and Esther, II. and III. (with no legendary connection
of which I am aware) Scenes in the Life of S.
Augustine. The first is the finest. Ahasuerus, surrounded
by his councillors, bends forward, and touches
with his sceptre the head of the kneeling Esther. His
figure is very like that of the David in the foregoing
picture. On the right is a fine back view of one of
the characteristic swaggering soldiers in tight striped
clothes. The treatment is broad, but the drawing
in parts is somewhat careless. In the other two
scenes, the composition is jerky and insignificant, but
the individual figures are characteristic, especially the
nude <i>&eacute;corch&eacute;</i>-like old saint. They represent visions
which appear in the air to S. Augustine, who sits
below under a <i>loggia</i>.</p>

<p>Again, very close to the Arezzo altar-piece is "The
Conception of the Virgin," painted for the church of
the Ges&ugrave;, Cortona, now in the Cathedral. The Virgin
stands, on the usual cherub heads, in red and blue
robes, while God the Father bends over her, and two
angels scatter flowers through the air. Below are six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
prophets, among them David, with his Psaltery, and
Solomon, in crown and royal robe. Under the Virgin,
apparently supporting the cherubs, is the Tree of
Life, with two very fine nude figures of Adam and
Eve receiving the fruit from the serpent. It is the
lower part only we have to consider, the whole of
the upper painting, with the weak, badly-draped
Virgin and the theatrical angels being certainly the
work of assistants, as also, it seems to me, is the
drapery of the half-kneeling Prophet to the right.
The David is exactly the same figure as in the
Arezzo altar-piece, to which, besides, there is a great
resemblance in all the faces, and in the hard coarse
manner in which the draperies are treated. The
picture, however, lacks the rugged strength which
makes the Arezzo picture, with all its shortcomings,
so impressive, and only in the nude figures is the old
power unimpaired. These, however, are very good,
the Adam especially being as fine a study of the
human form as any of the earlier work.</p>

<p>At Morra, a little village not far from Citt&agrave; di
Castello, in the church of San Crescenziano, are two
very important frescoes, a "Crucifixion" and a
"Flagellation," evidently very late work of the master.
In the latter the composition is very little altered
from the early picture of the Brera. Christ is in the
centre, bound to the pillar, and on the right stands
the Roman soldier. The executioner near him is
almost a repetition of the magnificent drawing in the
Louvre (see reproduction), except that the legs are
wide apart. All Signorelli's energies have again gone
into the figures of the executioners, but, fine as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
are, they are not treated with the same breadth as in
the earlier picture, albeit the painting is free almost to
roughness. The background, instead of the carved wall,
now opens out of the court into a spacious landscape.</p>

<p>In the "Crucifixion," the group at the foot of the
Cross is arranged much like those of the San Sepolcro,
Urbino, and Cortona pictures, but it is half lost in the
confusion of a crowd of mounted soldiers. The impressive
silence and solemnity of these earlier "Piet&agrave;s"
is changed here to a scene of noisy turmoil, and the
painter's interest is obviously centred on the movement
of this hustling crowd. The horses are badly
drawn and ill-balanced, as in the Louvre "Adoration,"
and the Magdalen is very coarsely painted. The animation
and action are well rendered, but something of
the grandeur of his earlier work is sacrificed.</p>

<p>This grandeur was, however, fully regained in the
last work of the master, painted in 1523, the very
year of his death&mdash;"The Coronation of the Virgin," in
the Collegiata of Foiano, a small town near Sinalunga.</p>

<p>The Virgin, in red robes and greenish-blue mantle,
with fair hair, kneels before Christ, who places the
crown on her head. On either side two angels play
musical instruments, and on the right and left stand
S. Joseph and the Archangel Michael. In the foreground
kneels S. Martin, to whom the altar-piece was
dedicated, in a magnificent gold cope, having on his
left S. Jerome with a grey loin-cloth. Farther back
are three monks, and behind S. Martin stands the
Magdalen, while on the other side an old saint
introduces the donor, Angelo Massarelli. The general
tone of colour is not nearly so heavy as in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Arezzo painting, the reds are of a pale rose-colour,
and only the flesh-tints of S. Jerome are very dark.
This figure and the S. Martin are nobly and powerfully
conceived. The donor recalls the portrait of
the Gamurrini of Arezzo.</p>

<p>The painting does not seem to be the unassisted
work of Signorelli, the S. Michael being too insignificant
a figure, and the Magdalen too weakly executed
to be by his own hand. The <i>predella</i> bears evidence
that he had an assistant, for, of the four stories of S.
Martin, which they illustrate, only two are by the
master. These two are very fine and bold, in composition
and brushwork. In the first the Saint, clad
in armour, is seated on the characteristic white horse,
with a man-at-arms behind him, and divides his
cloak with the nude beggar. The background is a
broadly-painted landscape. The other represents the
Saint kneeling before a Bishop and two acolytes,
clothed in a green tabard, a romantic and beautiful
figure. The two remaining divisions are larger in size,
and obviously the work of assistants, one illustrating S.
Martin exorcising a mad bull, the other his funeral and
the miraculous healing of the sick by the dead body.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to have to conclude the list of
works with one so strong, and which combines so
many of the qualities which we have learnt to look
for in Signorelli's painting. Rugged energy, dignity,
decorative grace, and even romantic beauty are all to
be found in this altar-piece, which is a fit ending to
the life's work of the master.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<h3>DRAWINGS</h3>


<p>The study of Signorelli's drawings is unsatisfactory,
both by reason of their scarcity, and the enormous
difference of merit, even among those few which can
be considered as genuine. Morelli writes: "His drawings
are found in all the most important collections of
Europe,"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> but he mentions only thirteen, and although
many certainly in all the galleries bear his name, and
the impress of his influence, later study appears to
accept only six as by his own hand; and of these six
two are so much inferior to the rest that I cannot bring
myself to feel any degree of certainty as to their
genuineness.</p>

<p>This difficulty of acceptance arises from a comparison
with the very high standard of excellence
in the two magnificent studies of the nude in the
Louvre collection, which correspond, in breadth of
feeling, in grandeur of pose, and in boldness and
accuracy of touch, to his best brushwork.</p>

<p>No. 345, formerly in the Baldinucci collection, represents
two nude male figures of superb proportions,
one standing with his hands on his hips, the other,
in the characteristic attitude with wide-spread, firmly-planted
feet, having his hand on the shoulder of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
first. It is in black chalk, dashed in swiftly, with
bold sweeping strokes, apparently direct from the
life. It is one of the finest studies of the nude in
existence, both for the splendid anatomy of the figures
and the freedom and energy of touch. No. 343, also
from the Baldinucci collection, which is here reproduced,
is hardly inferior to it in the same qualities of
boldness and freedom. It seems to be the study from
which Signorelli painted the executioner in <i>grisaille</i>
near the "Piet&agrave;," in Orvieto, and later the scourging
figure of the Morra "Flagellation," although in both
there are slight differences of position. The action is
exceedingly fine, the poise of the figure on the well-drawn
feet being especially good, while all the force
of the strong body is thrown into the arms stretched
high up over the head.</p>

<p>In Dresden is a sheet of studies, which, while less
fine than these two, are yet very characteristic, and
undoubtedly genuine. They are also in black chalk,
but very much rubbed, and consequently rather indistinct
They represent four nude figures in different
postures, which Morelli considers to be studies for
part of the Orvieto frescoes, although I have failed
to discover there anything which corresponds to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Louvre, Paris</i></p>
<p class="caption center">STUDY OF NUDE FIGURE</p>
</div>

<p>In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, is another black
chalk study of two men being chained by devils, which,
again, seems as though it must have been intended for
some of the figures in the "Damnation," but which I
cannot find there. This drawing is also very characteristic,
and although falling far below the merit of the
Louvre studies, has all Signorelli's qualities of dramatic
energy and strength of touch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The heavy, coarse study for a "Death of Lucretia,"
also in the Uffizi, I find extremely hard, in comparison
with any of the foregoing, to accept as an undoubted
work of the master, although I am not prepared to
absolutely deny it. There is a want of proportion
in the figures, and an indecision in the strokes, hard
to reconcile with all we know of his work.</p>

<p>In the collection at Windsor is another chalk drawing&mdash;"Hercules
overcoming Ant&aelig;us"&mdash;of little merit
either of anatomy or of technique, but which may
possibly be from his hand. There is something of the
influence of Antonio Pollaiuolo visible in this treatment
of his favourite subject, and it is just conceivable
that it may be an early study by Signorelli done in his
workshop.</p>

<p>The list of all the drawings which are attributed to
him in different collections would take too long for the
slight purpose it would serve; but for the benefit of
those who desire to compare for themselves those
which Morelli and Vischer decide to be genuine, I have
added a list of their attributions, transcribed without
addition or correction.</p>

<h3>PUPILS AND GENERAL INFLUENCE</h3>


<p>It would not be possible, in the space at my disposal,
to go with any thoroughness into the work of
Signorelli's imitators, even of those who fell directly
under his influence. The painters who stand foremost
among them, Don Bartolommeo della Gatta and
Girolamo Genga, are both too important to be dealt
with in a short notice, while it would be a thankless as
well as an arduous task, to try to distinguish the different
painters of what is generically classed as school-work,
being, as it nearly always is, without either individuality
or merit. I shall do little more, therefore, than make
a brief mention of the names and principal works of
the known imitators, and try instead to indicate the
influence of Signorelli's style upon painting in general.</p>

<p>Morelli says much of his "uncompromising guidance,"
and of the "degeneration" of those who fell
under his "crushing influence."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Something of the
sort has been said of Michelangelo, and might be said
of every strong man whose personality is powerful
enough to stamp its mark on his contemporaries, but
since no one who is content to be merely a copyist
could produce valuable work, the world has probably
lost little by the submission. It is, however, true that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
as the powerful muscles of Michelangelo's statues
become meaningless lumps in the works of Bandinelli
and Vasari, so the mannerisms of Signorelli, which were
the outward sign of his strong and energetic temperament,
lost all significance, and were merely coarse
exaggerations in the work of his imitators. The
swaggering attitude, the freedom of gesture, and the
dramatic expression, shorn of the strength and earnest
emotion from which they sprang, became disagreeably
incongruous in the pictures of the feeble painters who
imitated them.</p>

<p>But one, at least, of Signorelli's disciples was neither
slavish nor feeble. Bartolommeo della Gatta, otherwise
Piero di Antonio Dei, the most important of those
who came under his influence, was a painter of great
charm and ability. If it be true, as a recent criticism
has pronounced, that the beautiful "Madonna," of the
Christ Church collection, Oxford, there attributed to
Pier dei Franceschi, is from his brush,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> we have to deal
with a man who started work under the same ennobling
influence as Signorelli himself. Be that as it may, and
as future research will decide, the fresco of "The Death
of Moses," in the Sistine Chapel, which later study has
presumed to be almost entirely his work, proves him to
be a painter of great beauty and importance. Signor
Gaetano Milanesi has thrown doubt upon his existence
as a painter of anything except miniatures,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but the
happy discovery of a document, referring to his altar-piece
of "S. Francis receiving the stigmata," in the
Church of that Saint in Castiglione Fiorentino, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
placed the fact beyond dispute.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The student who
desires to know more of this painter is referred to the
last Italian edition of Cavalcaselle e Crowe, vol. viii.,
and to the "Life" by Vasari, whose reliability in this case
the researches of the critics so well confirm. Born probably
in 1408, he was already a man of mature age
when Signorelli himself was a child, but his simple,
pliable nature fitted him to be a follower rather than a
leader, and we find him now influenced by Pier dei
Franceschi, now by Signorelli, and again later by
Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. If it be true that the really
splendid painting of the Sistine Chapel is due to him
entirely, it is, of course, his masterpiece, and reaches,
indeed, a level not very inferior to that of Signorelli
himself. His most important undisputed works are
the above-mentioned painting in the church of S.
Francesco, Castiglione Fiorentino, the altar-piece in
the Collegiata of the same town, a S. Rock in the
Gallery, and a fresco of S. Jerome, in the Bishop's
Palace, Arezzo, etc.</p>

<p>Another imitator of importance, Girolamo Genga,
impressionable as his nature was, yet has much individual
excellence to distinguish him from the rest of
Signorelli's assistants. Born at Urbino in 1476, he was
placed, at the age of fifteen, in the studio of Signorelli,
with whom, according to Vasari, he remained for twenty
years, becoming "one of the best pupils that he had."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
After assisting the master in the painting of the Cappella
Nuova, Orvieto, Genga (always according to the same
authority) placed himself to study perspective with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Perugino, at the time that Raffaelle was also under the
influence of that painter. This, as well as the fact that
he was a native of Urbino, and had probably also felt the
impression of Timoteo Viti, would account for the enormous
influence Raffaelle's painting had upon his later
work. He seems to have had an extraordinary facility
for changing his style; for, while under the influence of
Signorelli, as in the Petrucci Palace frescoes (Nos. 375
and 376 in the Gallery of Siena), his work bears so
much resemblance to that of the master, that so observant
a critic as Morelli declared the composition of both
to be most certainly by Luca himself.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Genga seems
to have caught, not the superficial forms only, but also
the spirit of Signorelli in these frescoes, for in one&mdash;"The
Flight of &AElig;neas from Troy"&mdash;there is an
exaggeration of the characteristic energy and movement,
which, almost hysterical though it be, is yet
successful and full of real life; while in the swaggering
strength of the nude figures in "The Rescue of
Prisoners" there is something of Luca's own dignity
and impressiveness. In his later work, although he
never departs from certain likenesses to his first master,
yet he gives himself up to the influence of Raffaelle
unreservedly, as may be best seen in the Cesena altar-piece,
now in the Brera, Milan. Morelli writes of him:
"This eclectic painter, who, though working in a
baroque style, is not without talent, is confounded with
the most diverse masters, both in drawings and paintings";<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and the fact that besides the above-mentioned
variations of style, his work is also pardonably attributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to Girolamo del Pacchia<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and to Sodoma,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> fully justifies
the epithet and the assertion. Of the other and less important
followers, Tommaso Bernabei, called Papacello,
seems to have been first assistant of Giulio Romano,
and then of Giambattista Caporali, with whom he is
said to have painted the frescoes in the Villa Passerini,
near Cortona. His first original work is of the year
1524&mdash;a "Conception of the Virgin," in the church of
Santa Maria del Calcinaio, near Cortona, in which the
manner of Signorelli is very apparent. In the same
church are two other paintings by him, dated 1527, an
"Adoration of the Magi," and an "Annunciation,"
which are sufficient to indicate the small amount of
artistic ability of the painter. The date of his birth is
unknown; he died in 1559.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>We have, besides, four members of Signorelli's own
family. First, his son Polidoro, whom we know to
have been his assistant at Orvieto; for, in a document
of 1501, he is mentioned as having received certain
payments there for salary, as well as for materials
for the work.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> His manner of painting is unknown
to us, so that it is impossible to distinguish his share
in the frescoes.</p>

<p>Two other sons, Antonio and Pier Tommaso, were,
it seems, also assistants of their father, the former being
the painter of a dated altar-piece in the church of Santa
Maria del Calcinaio, near Cortona.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Lastly, his nephew
Francesco, the most important of the assistants bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
his own name, from whose hand there are several paintings
very close to the master in style. To him, at least,
are attributed the standard of "The Baptism," in the
Gallery of Citt&agrave; di Castello, and a <i>Tondo</i> of a "Madonna
and Saints," in the Palazzo Pubblico, Cortona. There is
one signed altar-piece by him, "The Conception of the
Virgin," in the choir of S. Francesco, Gubbio.</p>

<p>Turpino Zaccagna is another pupil, of whom Manni
writes that he was a noble youth of Cortona, who
took to painting, and imitated Signorelli's style.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Of
his work remains an altar-piece in the church of S.
Agata di Cantalena, near Cortona, signed and dated
1537.</p>

<p>With him the list of known pupils closes. But
more really important than either of these minor
scholars is the unknown imitator who painted the
beautiful "Magdalen," of the Florence Academy.
Executed on linen, and evidently intended for a
church standard, this is the most successful of all
the works in Signorelli's manner, which yet cannot
be accepted as genuine. The design of the principal
figures in the foreground and middle distance I believe
to be by Signorelli himself, and the intensity of emotion
in the Magdalen, who has cast herself at the foot of
the Cross, and the impressive grandeur of the three
figures to the right, have lost none of the original
spirit of the master. The colour is entirely different,
and would alone preclude the acceptance of the
painting as Signorelli's work, but, moreover, the
general effect has so little of his sweeping breadth,
and the details of the shadowy landscape are so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
poorly composed, that it is probable even the whole
of the drawing is not by him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<a id="Figure_41" name="Figure_41"></a>
<img src="images/i164.jpg" width="339" height="691" alt="TIBERIUS GRACCHUS" title="" />
<p style="text-align:right" class="smaller">[<i>Gallery, Buda-Pesth</i></p>
<p class="caption center">TIBERIUS GRACCHUS</p>
</div>

<p>An interesting picture in the Gallery of Buda-Pesth,
there attributed to Luca himself, connects the charming
and mysterious "Griselda" series (Nos. 912, 913, and
914), of the National Gallery,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> with some follower of
Signorelli, for it is sufficient to glance at the background
of this "Tiberius Gracchus" to be convinced
that its painter is the same unknown master. In the
"Griselda" pictures there is more evidence than here
of the influence of Pintorricchio, to whom they are,
not unnaturally, attributed; while in the "Tiberius,"
in the drapery of the figure, and the type of the
children who support the tablet, especially, there is
much of the real spirit of Signorelli, as well as a
good deal of his breadth and solidity of drawing.
The painter must, for the present, remain as an unknown
Umbrian, almost equally influenced by Pintorricchio
and Luca, and with peculiar qualities of simple
grace and romance, which give his work an extremely
individual character.</p>

<p>Very different is the imitation of Signorelli's mannerisms
in such works as "The Nativity," of the National
Gallery, "The Madonna and Saints," of the Gallery of
Citt&agrave; di Castello, and "The Abbondanza," of the Uffizi.
In these the imitation is mechanical, and without any
comprehension of the master's spirit. It would be
useless to mention more of the school-work, in which
superficial excellences and defects are copied with
equal zeal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the spiritual qualities which
these mechanical imitators missed, were felt intensely
by men who never adopted his mannerisms, and it
is in the work of these that the real effect of Signorelli's
influence is to be found. The frescoes of Orvieto
never became, like Masaccio's in the Carmine, a school
to which the younger painters thronged, purposely to
learn the methods of the master, but their impressive
grandeur and solemnity, and the breadth of brushwork
and solid modelling by which these qualities were in
a great measure obtained, worked, nevertheless, a very
important change in the Art of the time, and a wave
of strong fresh blood was sent through its veins. Without
them, perhaps, we should never have had the same
appeal to the imagination and the nobler instincts in
the Sistine paintings, although there is not in the
whole of the work one single mannerism from Signorelli's
style.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> But what is called the "Terribilit&agrave;" of the
older master was entirely free from the sombre melancholy
which strikes so gloomy a note in the work of
Michelangelo. Signorelli's greatest gift to us is his conception
of humanity, not only of its robust strength,
but of its mental vigour. His figures are solemn, but it
is a solemnity untainted with sadness, conscious only
of the dignity of the human race, its significance
and responsibilities.</p>

<p>By his power over his materials, won by hard study,
he added much to Art, and presented things, not as
conventional symbols, but as they are actually reflected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
on the eye. His people stand on solid ground by the
help of firm muscle, substantial realities that we feel
could be touched and walked round. His atmosphere
gives the sense of real space and air. His trees seem
to have roots, and their branches to be full of sap. By
this truth and power of presenting things as they are
he was able to endow his paintings with his own conception
of Nature, grander and wider than our own,
and to make us see mankind with his eyes, built on
broader, stronger lines. Nothing trivial or insignificant
enters into his perception of life. He takes his place
with Mantegna, with D&uuml;rer, and with Cossa, the austere
painters, who felt the dignity of life to lie in rugged
strength, iron resolution, and unflinching self-reliance.</p>
